## 1. Title and Description

Establish the EKS project foundation and the canonical, schema-driven pipeline substrate that all subsequent phases build upon. Deliverables: (1) AGENTS.md-compliant project folder structure and conda environment; (2) canonical 3-layer schema design (base/setup/config) across core, asset, and ontology sets — including the universal plant-item asset schema with 13 reusable fragments and zero-code extensibility, ISO 15926 ontology integration, and the enhanced document schema v2 with type/file/element registries; (3) schema-driven SSOT global parameters and universal system parameters (runtime behavior config); (4) document ingestion plug-ins for PDF/DOCX/XLSX plus a DuckDB-backed document registry with full CRUD and revision management (preserve-all revisions + latest-revision flag); (5) tiered logging (levels 0–3), debug object, and structured trace table, along with a schema-driven error/message catalog and per-document 6-dimension health scoring; (6) the end-to-end discovery → register → route → parse → detect → score → review pipeline (auto-DDL generation, file scanner, parser router, orchestrator with rollback, manual review workflow); (7) universal path resolution and a converged pipeline entry point (CLI + web + per-phase HTTP backend) funneling through a shared `run_pipeline(context)` / `bootstrap_pipeline()` helper; and (8) initiation integrity, config flattening, cross-cutting remediation, and architectural patterns (BaseEngine, Validator, factories, setup validation, data_dir traversal guard).
 This phase creates the bedrock that all subsequent phases build upon.

## 2. Revision Control & Version History

| Version | Date       | Author | Summary of Changes                            |
| :------ | :--------- | :----- | :-------------------------------------------- |
| 3.52    | 2026-07-11 | opencode | **Workplan audit & gap remediation (G1–G4 + color key)**: Re-audited all Phase 1 tasks against code. G3 — corrected §8 status column for T1.69/T1.70/T1.72/T1.73/T1.75/T1.76 (severity emojis 🟠/🔴/🟡 → ✅; all six verified implemented). G1 — reclassified T1.56 (CLI Entry Points) to 🔶 PARTIAL: only `eks/engine/parsers/cli.py` is real (T1.99b); `eks/engine/core/discovery_cli.py` + `health_cli.py` are stubs returning placeholder SUCCESS (no standalone discovery/health engines built) — tracked as I093. G2 — T1.57 detail corrected: HTTP API is `eks/ui/backend/phase1_server.py`; `engine_endpoints.py` archived in T1.99d. G4 — §9 files table corrected: `project_setup.json` Create→Deleted (T1.67); `engine_endpoints.py`→`phase1_server.py` (archived); discovery/health CLI paths fixed to `engine/core/`. Color key — §14 Mermaid: ENTRY nodes ECLI/EWEB/ERUN were styled amber while labeled ✅ COMPLETE; recoloured to green; legend text tidied to "🔶 Partial / Planned"; §4 Status Legend aligned to "✅ PASS / COMPLETE | 🔶 PARTIAL | ❌ FAIL | 🔷 PLANNED" and notes severity emojis are not status values. Top status notes T1.56 partial. |
| 3.51    | 2026-07-11 | opencode | **T1.99a–g COMPLETE (I092 / R60)**: Implemented Phase 1 entry-point convergence. T1.99a — new `eks/engine/core/pipeline_runner.py` with `bootstrap_pipeline()` + `run_pipeline(context)` (ConfigRegistry → SchemaLoader.load_all → DocumentRegistry → ErrorManager/MessageManager → ProjectSetupValidator readiness gate → PipelineOrchestrator.run_full_pipeline → checkpoint + on_phase callback). T1.99b — `eks/engine/parsers/cli.py` rewritten as real end-to-end CLI + `eks/pyproject.toml` `eks-pipeline` console_scripts. T1.99c — `phase1_server._run` wired to `run_pipeline()` (409 guard + resolve_paths preserved). T1.99d — orphan `ui/backend/engine_endpoints.py` archived to `archive/ui/backend/` (no references). T1.99e — canonical `eks/serve.py` added (§18.12); `server.py` becomes thin re-export shim. T1.99f — `bootstrap_pipeline()` uses `ConfigRegistry` singleton SSOT (resets singleton when a different config_dir is requested to avoid test pollution; soft readiness gate logs + continues even when `fail_fast:true`). T1.99g — new `eks/test/test_pipeline_runner.py` (CLI smoke + run_pipeline exercised); fixed `project_root` depth bug (`parent×4`) in cli.py + pipeline_runner.py; fixed `phase1_server._run` cancellation bug — a cancelled job previously had its `"cancelled"` status overwritten with `"failed"` when the running thread caught the `Pipeline cancelled` RuntimeError, making `test_pipeline_cancel` flaky; cancellation now preserves `"cancelled"` status and logs as STATUS not ERROR. Full EKS suite 257/257 green (stable across repeated runs). I092 narrowed to remaining Phases 2–5. U139. |
| 3.50    | 2026-07-11 | opencode | **§14 architecture diagram — three entry points (I092 / R60)**: Added `ENTRY` subgraph to the §14 Mermaid diagram showing three pipeline entry points — ① CLI (`eks/engine/cli.py`, T1.99b 🔷 PLANNED), ② Web (`eks/serve.py`, T1.99e 🔷 PLANNED), ③ HTTP Backend (`phase1_server.py`, ✅ exists, T1.99c) — all converging on a shared `run_pipeline(context)`/`bootstrap_pipeline()` helper (T1.99a 🔷 PLANNED) which feeds into the Bootstrap subgraph. Planned nodes colour-coded amber. Doc-only change. |
| 3.49    | 2026-07-11 | opencode | **T1.99a–g PLANNED (I092 / R60)**: Added §21 Pipeline Entry-Point & Per-Phase Sub-Pipeline Convergence. Proposed extracting shared `run_pipeline(context)`/`bootstrap_pipeline()` helper (T1.99a), unified CLI + `console_scripts` (T1.99b), wiring `phase1_server._run` to `run_full_pipeline` (T1.99c), deleting orphan `engine_endpoints.py` (T1.99d), adding `eks/serve.py` (T1.99e), `ConfigRegistry` SSOT at entry (T1.99f), tests (T1.99g). Per-phase backend tasks added to Phases 2–5 (T2.25–T2.26, T3.36–T3.37, T4.26–T4.27, T5.21–T5.22). All 🔷 PLANNED for review. No implementation. |
| 3.48    | 2026-07-11 | opencode | **Workplan diagram consistency fix**: Corrected §14 Bootstrap Mermaid subgraph stale markers — nodes I72A/I72B (T1.72), CKPT (T1.73), M75 (T1.75), M76 (T1.76) were labelled 🔷/🔶 "pending"/amber although completed in v3.29; recoloured to ✅ green and updated legend node L2 to a generic amber color key. No task status changed — all Phase 1 tasks remain ✅. |
| 3.47    | 2026-07-11 | opencode | **T1.98 COMPLETE**: §20 Universal Path Resolution & Schema-Driven Initialization (I089 + I090). Adopted EKS `global_paths` as universal canonical path pattern (L16) via new `common/library/paths/resolver.py` (`resolve_paths`, `ResolvedPaths`) normalizing EKS + DCC shapes; wired `ConfigRegistry` + `phase1_server.py`; added `workflow_files`/`tool_files` to EKS schema + config (`workflow_file_entry_def`/`tool_file_entry_def`) for DCC parity; `setup_validator.py` validates them; `folder_creation` satisfied by canonical `global_paths`. Universal architecture doc L16 + §3.18 + §2.2/§2.3/§2.4/§4.1/§4.2/§9/§10. `eks/knowledge.json` v2.6.0. 252/252 tests pass. I089 + I090 closed. |

Phase 1.3 stand-alone workplan archived in `eks/archive/`. |
| 3.29    | 2026-07-08 | opencode | Expanded Bootstrap closure scope: added T1.75 (activate ErrorManager/MessageManager in phase1_server — closes silent T1.68 gap where managers were never passed to the running server) and T1.76 (persist debug_log.json + message/status JSON to `eks/output/` per AGENTS.md §7/§19). Updated T1.69 (run_id correlation) and T1.73 (checkpoint to `eks/output/checkpoints/{job_id}.json`). Updated §4 scope, §8 task table, §9 files table, §14 Mermaid, and test report. |
| 3.28    | 2026-07-08 | opencode | Implemented T1.68 (wired ErrorManager/MessageManager into PipelineOrchestrator), T1.71 (added update_document_status + _with_retry to registry), T1.74 (anchored phase1_server paths to PRJ_DIR, EKSPaths.to_dict uses .asposix()).

| 3.25    | 2026-07-08 | System | Added note that shared common-library package structure under `common/library` now exists for architecture-aligned logging, telemetry, pipeline, errors, messages, paths, validation, UI, and factory modules; documented as a reusable foundation for future EKS integration work. |
| 3.24    | 2026-07-08 | System | Added T1.68–T1.73: wire ErrorManager/MessageManager into orchestrator (T1.68), add run_id correlation ID to EKSLogger (T1.69), add data_dir traversal guard to phase1_server.py (T1.70), replace raw duckdb.connect in _update_doc_status with registry method (T1.71), enforce DiscoveryInput/Output and ParserInput/Output contracts in orchestrator phases (T1.72), persist checkpoint JSON to disk in _run() thread (T1.73). |
| 3.23    | 2026-07-08 | System | Added T1.74 (cross-platform path compatibility) addressing 4 gaps: unanchored relative paths in phase1_server.py, backslash paths in _handle_config_paths, EKSPaths.to_dict() using str() not as_posix(), and context.py checkpoint serialization. |
| 3.22 | 2026-07-01 | opencode | Enhanced §14 Mermaid diagram with explicit function call annotations per pipeline step. Added §14.1 Function Table (11 module tables) per AGENTS.md §17 — covers all pipeline-critical functions with description, parameters, return values, dependencies, error handling, and tracing. |

## 6. Evaluation and Alignment with Existing Architecture

- **Schema pattern**: Directly adopts `project_setup_base.json / project_setup.json / project_config.json` from `dcc/config/schemas`
- **Logging**: Directly adopts tiered logging and debug object from `dcc/workflow/core_engine/` patterns
- **Module design**: SSOT global parameters via schema-driven config per AGENTS.md Section 4
- **New**: Document registry with metadata DB is new to this workspace; no prior precedent in DCC

---

## 7. Dependencies with Other Tasks

1. **AGENTS.md** — Governs all coding standards, module design, logging
2. **dcc/config/schemas** — Schema base/setup/config pattern to replicate
3. **External**: DuckDB (preferred for dev) or PostgreSQL for metadata DB
4. **Next Phase**: Phase 2 depends on document registry and parsers from this phase

---

## 7b. Proposed Project Folder Structure

The EKS project folder follows the standard structure defined in `AGENTS.md`. All folders are created in Phase 1 (T1.1) as empty scaffolding so subsequent phases can populate them without restructuring.

**Notes:**
- Folders for all phases (chunking, embedding, graph, retrieval, cache, ui) are created as **empty scaffolding** in Phase 1 (T1.1) to establish the full layout upfront
- Each phase populates only its designated folders; no folder restructuring is needed later
- `data/` is for raw input documents supplied by the user; not committed to version control
- `output/` holds runtime artifacts (debug logs, exported graphs); not committed to version control

## 7c. Detailed Schema Design (T1.3 - T1.5)

Following the standards in `AGENTS.md` Section 2 (Schema Fragments & Inheritance) and Section 4 (SSOT), the EKS canonical schema is designed across three files to separate definitions, declarations, and actual values.

### T1.3: `eks_base_schema.json` (Definitions)
- **Purpose**: Store reusable fragments and type definitions (`definitions` or `$defs`).
- **Standard**: Flat structure, use array of objects, `additionalProperties: false`.
- **Key Definitions**:
    - `discipline_code`: Enum (PI, EL, IN, CI, ME, etc.) for engineering discipline identification.
    - `revision_id`: String with regex pattern (e.g., `^[A-Z0-9]{1,2}$`) for strict revision control.
    - `ProjectMetadata`: Shared fragment for project identification (title, number, area, discipline, department).
    - `DocumentMetadata`: Shared fragment for document identification (type, number, revision, status, latest_flag).
    - `EngineeringObject`: Fragment for engineering items (tag, object_type, properties dict).
    - `SourceTraceability`: Fragment for chunk source tracking (file_path, page, section, chunk_id).
        - **Asset Schema Fragments (R36, R39)** — 13 fragments for universal plant item schema (see [appendix_a_asset_schema.md](appendix_a_asset_schema.md)):
        - `item_core_def`, `process_conditions_def`, `manufacturer_def`, `asset_lifecycle_def`, `control_system_def`, `piping_connection_def`, `valve_internals_def`, `actuator_def` (full manufacturer+lifecycle block), `rotating_equipment_def`, `instrumentation_def`, `pipeline_route_def`, `specialist_equipment_def` (UV/filtration/conveyor), `motor_control_def` (starter type, MCC feed). `conditional_fragments` structure added for zero-code extensibility (R39).

### T1.4: `eks_setup_schema.json` (Declarations / Properties)
- **Purpose**: Define the structure and metadata of the system configuration (`properties`).
- **Standard**: One-to-one match with `eks_base_schema.json` via `$ref`.
- **Sections**:
    - `global_paths`: Mandatory directory paths (data, output, archive, config).
    - `registry`: Metadata database configuration (type, connection_string, timeout).
    - `parsers`: Configuration for document parser plugins (enabled list, specific parser settings).
    - `embedding`: SSOT for embedding provider settings (active_provider, model_name, dimensions).
    - `vector_store`: Vector database configuration (qdrant_url, collection_name, distance_metric).
    - `graph_db`: Knowledge graph settings (neo4j_uri, credentials, relationship_labels).
    - `logging`: Tiered logging configuration (default_level, debug_file_path).
    - `asset_type_registry`: Tag-type-to-fragment mapping registry declaring which fragments compose each AT_ category.

### T1.5: `eks_config.json` (Actual Values / Config)
- **Purpose**: Store the actual runtime values used by the EKS engine.
- **Standard**: Validates strictly against `eks_setup_schema.json`.
- **Example SSOT Values**:
    - `registry.type`: "duckdb"
    - `registry.connection`: "output/eks_registry.db"
    - `embedding.active_provider`: "openai"
    - `vector_store.collection_name`: "eks_chunks"
    - `logging.default_level`: 1
    - `project_assets.WSD11.datadrop_path`: "data/twrp/datadrop/Datadrop Summary.xlsx"
    - `asset_type_registry.AT_EQUIP.fragments`: ["core", "process_conditions", "manufacturer", "asset_lifecycle", "control_system", "rotating_equipment"]

## 7d. Independent Parser Module Architecture (T1.8 - T1.11)

To support diverse engineering document types (PDF, Word, Excel, AutoCAD, DGN) while maintaining system extensibility, EKS implements a **Plug-in Parser Architecture**.

### 1. The Parser Interface (`BaseParser`)
Every independent parser module must inherit from the `BaseParser` abstract class located in `engine/parsers/base_parser.py`.
- **`parse(file_path)`**: Returns a list of standardized content dictionaries.
- **`extract_metadata(file_path)`**: Returns file-level metadata (e.g., author, system properties).
- **`get_source_location(element_id)`**: Maps content back to its physical/logical source (e.g., page, sheet, layer, coordinates).

### 2. Standardized Output Format
Regardless of the file type, parsers must output a unified structure to prevent downstream logic pollution:
- **Textual Data**: Content string with associated formatting hints.
- **Structural Metadata**: Section headings, table identifiers, or sheet names.
- **Source Context**: Page numbers (PDF/DOCX), Cell references (XLSX), or Layer names/Coordinates (DWG/DGN).

### 3. Schema-Driven Discovery (SSOT)
Parsers are mapped to file extensions in `eks_config.json`. The EKS engine uses this mapping to dynamically instantiate the correct parser at runtime:
```json
"parsers": {
    ".pdf": "engine.parsers.pdf_parser.PDFParser",
    ".docx": "engine.parsers.docx_parser.DocxParser",
    ".xlsx": "engine.parsers.xlsx_parser.XlsxParser",
    ".dwg": "engine.parsers.dwg_parser.DWGParserStub",
    ".dgn": "engine.parsers.dgn_parser.DGNParserStub"
}
```

### 4. Implementation Strategy
- **Phase 1**: Full implementation of PDF, DOCX, and XLSX parsers.
- **CAD Support**: `DWGParserStub` and `DGNParserStub` will be created to define the interface requirements, returning "Format supported - Implementation Pending" for future Phase 3 integration.

| T1.60 | Implement HealthScorerFactory | Factory with config-driven dimensions per Appendix F | R51 | ✅ | 2026-06-30 |
| T1.61 | Implement StructureDetectorFactory | Factory for structure detector instantiation per Appendix F | R99 | ✅ | 2026-06-30 |
| T1.62 | Update Engines to Use Factories | Refactor existing engines to use factories instead of direct instantiation per Appendix F | R26 | ✅ | 2026-06-30 |
| T1.63 | Enhance PipelineOrchestrator with Checkpoints | Add 5 clear phases (A-E) with telemetry heartbeat integration per Appendix F | R57 | ✅ | 2026-06-30 |
| T1.64 | Implement Phase Rollback Capability | Add checkpoint restoration mechanism for failed phases per Appendix F | R57 | ✅ | 2026-06-30 |
| T1.65 | Implement Project Setup Validator | Create `eks/engine/core/setup_validator.py` with auto-creation of missing folders per Appendix F | R99 | ✅ | 2026-06-30 |
| T1.66 | Create Project Setup Schema | Create `eks/config/schemas/project_setup.json` for setup validation per Appendix F | R99 | ✅ | 2026-06-30 |
| T1.67 | Integrate project_setup into core 3-layer schemas (I046) | Refactor `project_setup.json` content into `eks_base_schema.json` (4 new defs: `required_folder_setup_def`, `required_file_setup_def`, `environment_setup_def`, `validation_options_def`), `eks_setup_schema.json` (new `project_setup` property with `$ref`), and `eks_config.json` (actual values). Delete orphan `project_setup.json`. Refactor `setup_validator.py` to load from `ConfigRegistry` chain instead of hardcoded lists. Resolves I046. | R99 | ✅ | 2026-06-30 |
| T1.68 | Wire ErrorManager/MessageManager into pipeline orchestrator | Call `ErrorManager.handle_system_error()` and `ErrorManager.handle_data_error()` at runtime in `pipeline_orchestrator.py`: emit D4/D5 error codes on phase failures and per-file parse failures; call `MessageManager.format()` for D6 milestone messages at phase start/complete. Resolves AGENTS.md §5.9 violation. | R51 | ✅ Done | T1.70, T1.72 |
| T1.69 | Add run_id correlation ID to EKSLogger and _LogCapture | Add `run_id: Optional[str]` param to `EKSLogger.__init__`; prepend `[run_id]` to all log entries. In `phase1_server.py` `_handle_pipeline_start()`, pass `job_id` as `run_id` to `_LogCapture` and `PipelineOrchestrator` logger so all log entries for a job share a traceable ID (universal §3.12 Structured Logging & Correlation IDs). Persist per-run log to `eks/output/debug_log.json` (T1.76). | R33, R51 | ✅ | T1.76 |
| T1.70 | Add data_dir traversal guard to phase1_server.py | In `_handle_files_load()` and `_handle_pipeline_start()`, resolve `data_dir` against `PRJ_DIR` and check `is_relative_to(PRJ_DIR)` — return HTTP 403 if outside project root. Mirrors the guard already present in `_handle_list_dirs()`. | R99 | ✅ | — |
| T1.71 | Replace raw duckdb.connect in _update_doc_status | Replace `__import__('duckdb').connect(str(self.registry.db_path))` in `pipeline_orchestrator.py` `_update_doc_status()` with a call to a new `registry.update_document_status(doc_id, status, confidence, notes)` method that uses the existing `_with_retry()` wrapper and the registry singleton connection. | R02 | ✅ Done | T1.68 |
| T1.72 | Enforce DiscoveryInput/Output and ParserInput/Output contracts in orchestrator | Wrap `run_phase_a()` to construct `DiscoveryInput` and validate `DiscoveryOutput`; wrap `_process_file()` to construct `ParserInput` and validate `ParserOutput` — enforcing the `BaseEngine.run()` contract defined in `base.py` and `io_contracts.py`. | R57 | ✅ | — |
| T1.73 | Persist checkpoint JSON to disk in _run() thread | In `phase1_server.py` `_run()`, after each `_set_phase()` call, invoke `orchestrator.save_checkpoint(phase, checkpoint_path=PRJ_DIR / "eks" / "output" / f"checkpoint_{job_id}.json")` so checkpoint state survives server restarts (universal §3.11 Idempotency & Checkpointing). Resume from last completed phase on re-run. | R57 | ✅ | — |
| T1.74 | Cross-platform path compatibility | Fix 4 cross-platform gaps: (1) Anchor all bare relative paths in `phase1_server.py` `_run()` and `_handle_files_load()` to `PRJ_DIR` — `SchemaLoader(str(PRJ_DIR / "eks" / "config"))`, `orchestrator.initialize_context(data_dir=PRJ_DIR / data_dir, ...)`, `scanner.scan(PRJ_DIR / data_dir)`; (2) Fix `_handle_config_paths()` to return `as_posix()` strings instead of `str(Path)` which produces backslashes on Windows; (3) Fix `EKSPaths.to_dict()` in `context.py` to use `.as_posix()` for all path fields so checkpoint JSON is OS-portable; (4) Fix `EKSPipelineContext.from_dict()` to reconstruct `Path` objects from posix strings. Resolves I078–I081. | R99 | ✅ Done | T1.69, T1.70 |
| T1.75 | Activate ErrorManager/MessageManager in phase1_server | **Closes silent T1.68 gap**: `phase1_server.py` constructs `PipelineOrchestrator` WITHOUT passing `error_manager`/`message_manager`, so the T1.68 wiring is dead code in production. Construct `ErrorManager(registry.logger)` and `MessageManager(...)` loading `eks_error_config.json`/`eks_message_config.json`, and pass them to `PipelineOrchestrator(...)`. Verify D5/S-PIP error codes and D6 status messages appear in `GET /api/v1/pipeline/logs/{job_id}`. | R51, R99 | ✅ | T1.68, T1.76 |
| T1.76 | Persist debug/message/status JSON to eks/output | Per AGENTS.md §7/§19, generate machine-parseable run artifacts in `eks/output/`: (1) `debug_log.json` — pass `debug_file=eks/output/debug_log.json` to `EKSLogger("Phase1Server")` and call `save_debug_log()` at end of `_run()`; (2) `pipeline_status_{job_id}.json` — write final `_job_state[job_id]` summary; (3) `pipeline_messages_{job_id}.json` — write MessageManager/ErrorManager catalog output for the run. Mirrors DCC `dcc/output/` artifact convention. | R51, R99 | ✅ | T1.69, T1.75 |

## 10. Risks and Mitigation

| Risk                                         | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation                                                         |
| :------------------------------------------- | :--------: | :----: | :----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| DB schema changes cascade to downstream code | Medium     | High   | Schema-driven design isolates DB structure from processing logic   |
| PDF/DOCX parsing quality varies by doc type  | High       | Medium | Abstract parser interface allows per-format tuning; log errors     |
| DWG/DGN parsing requires CAD libraries       | High       | Low    | Deferred to Phase 3; stub plug-in interface stubbed in this phase  |
| Schema design diverges from dcc pattern      | Low        | Medium | Explicitly use dcc/config/schemas as template reference            |
| Metadata extraction accuracy is low          | Medium     | Medium | Implement Manual Verification workflow in Phase 5                  |

---

## 11. Potential Future Issues

- CAD format parsing (DWG/DGN) may require specialized third-party libraries or commercial services
- Large document volumes may require async/batch ingestion pipelines
- Document registry may need sharding or partitioning for very large corpora
- Manual verification queue may become a bottleneck if not optimized

## 15. Initiation Integrity, Hardening & Harmonization (T1.77–T1.89)

Phase 1 foundation is extended by two follow-on initiation work batches that close DCC-alignment gaps and universalize project-setup validation. Detailed test evidence lives in the consolidated foundation report (§15/§16) and in `../archive/phase_1_t179_t183_report.md` (RP-EKS-P1-T179-001, archived) for T1.79–T1.83.

### 15.1 Initiation Integrity (T1.77–T1.78)
- **T1.77**: `ProjectSetupValidator.validate_all()` + `get_readiness_status()` wired into `phase1_server._run()` fail-fast gate; `--debug`/`--level` CLI flags with effective-level logic; `data_dir` existence + `recursive` bool validated before concurrency guard. 8 validator unit tests + 3 server integration tests. 202/202 pass.
- **T1.78**: Remediation of DCC gaps — `eks.yml`→`eks/eks.yml` path fix, input-file readability (G2), dependency probe + output-path validation (G3/G4), `--skip-readiness` override (G5), error code constants (G7); fixed pre-existing `_LogCapture.level` bug. 207/207 pass.

### 15.2 Initiation Schema-Driven Hardening (T1.79–T1.83)
| Task | I-Ref | Description | Status |
| :--- | :---- | :---------- | :----: |
| T1.79 | I079 | Wire `P1-SETUP-*` error codes into `validate_all()` results; raise readiness failure via `ErrorManager.handle_system_error("P1-SETUP-READINESS")` | ✅ |
| T1.80 | I080 | Derive output/eks.yml paths from `global_paths` + schema config | ✅ |
| T1.81 | I081 | Remove hardcoded fallback lists duplicating `eks_config.json` (SSOT) | ✅ |
| T1.82 | I082/I083 | Honor `validation_options.auto_create_folders` + schema-driven input defaults | ✅ |
| T1.83 | I084 | Make `eks` package root schema-driven via `global_paths.eks_root` (10× `PRJ_DIR/"eks"` literals replaced) | ✅ |

Full test-case detail (T1.79-a … T1.83-c) is integrated into the foundation report §15.3 and the archived `../archive/phase_1_t179_t183_report.md`.

### 15.3 Initiation Harmonization (T1.84–T1.89) — see §16
Universal `ValidationManager` + EKS `project_setup` reshape to the DCC object model. Full scope, task breakdown, files, and success criteria are consolidated in §16 below (sourced from WP-EKS-P1.3-001).

## 16. Phase 1.3 — Initiation Schema & Validation Harmonization (T1.84–T1.89)

**Source workplan (archived)**: [phase_1.3_initiation_harmonization_workplan.md](../archive/phase_1.3_initiation_harmonization_workplan.md) — WP-EKS-P1.3-001
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE — T1.84–T1.89 all implemented. Universal `ValidationManager` in `common/library/utility/validation/`. EKS `project_setup` schema reshaped to DCC-aligned object model. DCC itself NOT modified (deferred follow-up).

### 16.1 Objective
Achieve **schema-design consistency** and **code-module universality** for project-setup validation, so that EKS and (later) DCC validate project structure through one shared, well-tested module and through schemas that follow the same shape. EKS's AGENTS.md §6-mandated folder names are preserved — only the *schema shape* (not the folder names) aligns with DCC.

### 16.2 Scope Summary

| :-- | :------- | :---- | :------ | :----: | :------ |
| R99 | Foundation & Compliance | Initiation Harmonization | Universal `ValidationManager` + EKS `project_setup` reshape to DCC object model | T1.84–T1.89 | T1.67, T1.77, T1.78, T1.79–T1.83 |
| T1.84 | Foundation | Universal ValidationManager | Create `common/library/utility/validation/manager.py` (path-agnostic) — `validate_folders`, `validate_named_files`, `validate_environment`, `validate_dependencies`, `validate_discovery_rules`, `validate_project_setup` | ✅ DONE | R99 |
| T1.85 | Schema | EKS schema reshape | Replace flat-array defs with DCC-aligned object defs (8 new defs) in `eks_base_schema.json` v1.7.0 + `eks_setup_schema.json` v1.4.0 | ✅ DONE | T1.84, T1.67 |
| T1.86 | Schema | Extract project_setup config | Create `eks_project_setup_config.json` v1.0.0; `eks_config.json` v1.5.0 references it | ✅ DONE | T1.85, T1.67 |
| T1.87 | Code | EKS validator adapter | `setup_validator.py` v0.7 thin adapter delegating to universal module; preserves `P1-SETUP-*` + ErrorManager wiring | ✅ DONE | T1.84, T1.86 |

| T1.89 | Docs | Workplan/log/knowledge update | Workplan, `knowledge.json` v2.3.0, `update_log` (U130), `issue_log` (I085 resolved), universal architecture doc, foundation report | ✅ DONE | T1.84–T1.88 |

### 16.3 Task Breakdown
- **T1.84** — Create universal `ValidationManager` in `common/library/utility/validation/manager.py` (path-agnostic, takes `base_path`), modeled on DCC's mature `validation_manager.py` + `initiation_engine/validators/items.py`. Methods: `validate_folders` (with `auto_created`), `validate_named_files` (generic for `root_files`/`schema_files`), `validate_environment` (location-aware), `validate_dependencies` (required/optional/engines probe), `validate_discovery_rules`, `validate_project_setup`. Structured result `{readiness, folders, files, environment, dependencies, error_codes[]}`; emits codes via `common/library/core/errors/error_manager.py`. Exported from `__init__.py`.
- **T1.85** — Reshape EKS base/setup schema defs to DCC-aligned object model. In `eks_base_schema.json`, replace flat-array defs (`required_folder_setup_def`, `required_engine_subfolder_setup_def`, `required_file_setup_def`, `environment_setup_def`, `validation_options_def`) with 8 object defs: `folder_entry_def`, `root_file_entry_def`, `schema_file_entry_def`, `discovery_rule_def`, `environment_entry_def`, `dependency_config_def`, `validation_rule_def`, `project_metadata_def`. In `eks_setup_schema.json`, reshape `project_setup` to `folders` / `root_files` / `schema_files` / `discovery_rules` / `environment` / `dependencies` / `validation_rules` / `project_metadata`; keep `additionalProperties: false`. `global_paths_def` untouched.
- **T1.86** — Extract `project_setup` instance data to `eks_project_setup_config.json` v1.0.0 (20 folders, root files, schema files, environment, dependencies, project metadata); remove inline `project_setup` from `eks_config.json` v1.5.0, wire via the `$ref`/`ConfigRegistry` mechanism used by `eks_project_rules_config.json` (T1.67). `global_paths` stays in `eks_config.json`.
- **T1.87** — Refactor `setup_validator.py` v0.7 to a thin adapter delegating to `common.library.validation.ValidationManager`. Preserve public `validate_all()` / `get_missing_items()` signatures, `P1-SETUP-*` error codes (universal generic codes mapped to `P1-SETUP-*`), and `ErrorManager.handle_system_error("P1-SETUP-READINESS")` readiness gate. Add `_convert_flat_to_object()` for backward compat.
- **T1.88** — Migrate `test_setup_validator.py` (19 tests) to object-array config; create `test_validation_manager.py` (20 tests) for the universal module. Full EKS suite 235/235 green.
- **T1.89** — Update workplan, `knowledge.json` v2.3.0, `update_log` (U130), `issue_log` (I085 resolved), `common/universal_pipeline_architecture_design.md`, and the foundation report. Generate `phase_1_t179_t183_report.md` (now archived in `eks/archive/`) and this §16 integration.

### 16.4 Files and Modules (T1.84–T1.89)
| File/Folder | Action | Purpose |
| :---------- | :----- | :------ |
| `common/library/utility/validation/manager.py` | Create | Universal, path-agnostic `ValidationManager` |
| `common/library/utility/validation/__init__.py` | Update | Export `ValidationManager` |
| `eks/config/schemas/eks_project_setup_config.json` | Create | Instance data for `project_setup` (object model) |
| `eks/config/schemas/eks_base_schema.json` | Update | Replace flat-array defs with 8 DCC-aligned object defs (v1.7.0) |
| `eks/config/schemas/eks_setup_schema.json` | Update | Reshape `project_setup` property (v1.4.0) |
| `eks/config/schemas/eks_config.json` | Update | Remove inline `project_setup`; keep `global_paths` + `$ref` (v1.5.0) |
| `eks/engine/core/setup_validator.py` | Update | Thin adapter delegating to universal `ValidationManager` (v0.7) |
| `eks/test/test_setup_validator.py` | Update | Migrate to object-array config; keep `P1-SETUP-*` + SSOT tests |
| `eks/test/test_validation_manager.py` | Create | Unit tests for universal module (20) |

### 16.5 Success Criteria
- [x] EKS `project_setup` schema shape matches DCC's (object arrays with metadata; per-folder `auto_created`).
- [x] Reusable `ValidationManager` exists in `common/library/utility/validation/` and is path-agnostic (usable by EKS and later DCC).
- [x] EKS validation runs through the universal module; `phase1_server.py` readiness gate, `P1-SETUP-*` codes, and `ErrorManager` wiring behaviorally unchanged.
- [x] Full EKS test suite green (235/235); universal module has its own tests (20).
- [x] DCC left untouched (deferred follow-up).
- [x] Workplan, `knowledge.json`, `update_log`, `issue_log`, and universal architecture doc updated.

## 17. Initiation Config Flattening — DCC project_config Pattern (T1.90–T1.95)

**Objective**: Align EKS `eks_config.json` with DCC `project_config.json` — store the actual setup values (`folders` / `root_files` / `schema_files` / `environment` / `dependencies` / `project_metadata` / `discovery_rules`) at the **top level** instead of nested under a `project_setup` wrapper. This makes the universal `ValidationManager` (and a future universal schema loader) work for both projects with **zero per-project branching**, completing the Phase 1.3 universality goal, and removes the orphaned `eks_project_setup_config.json` (T1.86 artifact).

## 18. Schema Discovery & Registration — Discovery-Driven Loading (T1.96)

**Objective**: Add discovery-driven schema registration to EKS by (a) extracting the shared `discover_schema_files()` function from DCC `ref_resolver.py:164-230` into the `common/` library, (b) adding `discovery_rules` data to `eks_config.json`, (c) refactoring `schema_loader.py` to use config-driven loading (explicit `schema_files` + `discovery_rules` glob), and (d) wiring `ValidationManager.validate_discovery_rules()` into `setup_validator.py`. Closes I087.

**Rationale**: Currently `schema_loader.py` hardcodes 22 filenames — adding a new schema set requires source code changes. DCC's `_extract_registered_schemas()` implements a reusable pattern: explicit `schema_files` merge with glob-based `discovery_rules`. Extracting this to `common/` makes it available to both projects and future phases.

## 19. System Parameters — SSOT Centralization (T1.97)

**Objective**: Centralize all runtime behavior knobs (`fail_fast`, `log_level`, `debug_mode`, `skip_readiness`, `retry_count`, `retry_delay`, `api_timeout`, `ollama_timeout`, `db_timeout`) into a schema-defined `system_parameters` block in `eks_config.json`. Create a universal `get_system_param()` function in `common/library/config/` that handles both EKS flat-object and DCC array-of-entries shapes. Remove hardcoded equivalents from `phase1_server.py`, `error_manager.py`, `registry.py`, `server.py`. Closes I088.

**Rationale**: Currently these values are scattered across global variables (`phase1_server.py:103-105`), constructor defaults (`error_manager.py:21`), function defaults (`registry.py:326`), and literal constants (`server.py:359,429`). I088 documents this as a SSOT violation versus DCC's `project_config.json → system_parameters` pattern. A universal `get_system_param()` in `common/` makes the fix reusable for DCC and future phases.

### 19.3 Universal Architecture Elevation (I091)

**Objective**: Elevate `system_parameters` from a project-specific implementation to a formally defined universal pipeline feature (L15) in `common/universal_pipeline_architecture_design.md`. Register `config` as an architecture-aligned sub-package in `common/library/__init__.py`.

**Rationale**: I091 documents that `common/library/config/__init__.py` exists with `normalize_system_parameters()` and `get_system_param()` but `config` is not listed as an architecture-aligned sub-package in `common/library/__init__.py`, not imported, and not documented in `common/universal_pipeline_architecture_design.md`. Both DCC and EKS implement `system_parameters` independently; the universal architecture must formalize it as L15.

## 20. Universal Path Resolution & Schema-Driven Initialization (I089 + I090)

**Objective**: (1) Adopt EKS's `global_paths` as the universal canonical schema-driven path pattern and provide a shared `PathResolver` in `common/library/paths/` that normalizes both EKS and DCC path shapes — closes **I089**. (2) Bring EKS to DCC parity for `workflow_files`/`tool_files`/`folder_creation` (schema-driven initialization) — closes **I090**.

**Rationale**: A re-audit of DCC's actual code (I089 re-evaluation) found its path model is weaker than EKS's:
- `base_path` is derived by **script-location traversal** (`default_base_path()` walks `Path(__file__).parents` to find `"workflow"`), not from config.
- `data`/`output` dirs are **hardcoded literals** (`base_path / "data"`, `base_path / "output"`).
- `discovery_rules[].directory` are used **only for schema discovery**, not working dirs.
- `folder_creation.required_directories[].name` is used only for auto-create checks.

By contrast, EKS's `global_paths` (hardened by T1.80/T1.82/T1.83 — no hardcoded fallbacks) is **genuinely schema-driven SSOT**. Therefore the universal pattern adopts EKS `global_paths` as canonical, with a bidirectional `PathResolver` normalizing DCC's shape into it. For I090, EKS gains `workflow_files`/`tool_files` blocks (currently absent), while `folder_creation` is satisfied by the resolver deriving the create-list from the canonical `global_paths` — EKS deliberately does **not** add a separate DCC-style `folder_creation` block (documented design decision).

### 20.1 Scope Summary

| ID | Category | Title | Details | Status | Related |
| :-- | :------- | :---- | :------ | :----: | :------ |
| T1.98a | Common | Add `common/library/paths/resolver.py` | `resolve_paths(project_root, config) -> ResolvedPaths` + `ResolvedPaths` dataclass (data_dir, output_dir, archive_dir, config_dir, log_dir, schema_dir, eks_root). Handles EKS `global_paths` directly; normalizes DCC `discovery_rules`/`folder_creation`/native `base_path/"data"` defaults into the canonical shape. | ✅ COMPLETE | I089 |
| T1.98b | Common | Export resolver from `common/library/paths/__init__.py` | Add `resolve_paths`, `ResolvedPaths` to package exports. | ✅ COMPLETE | I089 |
| T1.98c | Code | Wire EKS `ConfigRegistry` to resolver | Route `data_dir`/`output_dir`/all 6 path properties through `resolve_paths()`; uniform path access; `global_paths` stays canonical config shape. Update `phase1_server.py` to use resolver instead of inline `PRJ_DIR / _eks_root / gp.get(...)`. | ✅ COMPLETE | I089, T1.80, T1.82, T1.83 |
| T1.98d | Docs | Universal architecture doc elevation | Add **L16 — Path Resolution / Schema-Driven Paths** to §2.2 Inventory, §2.3 Package Structure, §2.4 detail in `common/universal_pipeline_architecture_design.md`; add **§3.18 Path Resolution Pattern** (canonical = EKS `global_paths`); update §4.1/§9/§10. | ✅ COMPLETE | I089 |
| T1.98e | Docs | Update `eks/knowledge.json` | Reflect L16 status and universal path-resolution alignment. | ✅ COMPLETE | I089 |
| T1.98f | Schema/Config | Add `workflow_files` + `tool_files` to EKS schema + config | Add `workflow_files_def`/`tool_files_def` to `eks_base_schema.json`; add properties to `eks_setup_schema.json`; add instance blocks to `eks_config.json` (parallel to DCC `project_config.json`). Decision: folder creation driven by canonical `global_paths` (resolver derives create-list) — no separate DCC-style `folder_creation` block. | ✅ COMPLETE | I090 |
| T1.98g | Code | EKS loader/initializer for `workflow_files`/`tool_files` | Add logic to `setup_validator.py`/`config_registry.py` to register the file manifest and auto-create declared dirs from `global_paths` via resolver (mirrors DCC consumption). | ✅ COMPLETE | I090, T1.98a |
| T1.98h | Testing | Tests + suite green | Add `eks/test/test_path_resolver.py` (EKS + DCC shape normalization) and `workflow_files`/`tool_files` schema tests; full EKS suite 243/243 green. Close I089, I090. | ✅ COMPLETE | I089, I090 |

### 20.2 Canonical `global_paths` Shape (adopted as universal)

```json
"global_paths": {
  "data_dir": "data", "output_dir": "output", "archive_dir": "archive",
  "config_dir": "config", "log_dir": "log", "eks_root": "eks"
}
```

DCC's `discovery_rules` + `folder_creation` + native `base_path/"data"` defaults are **normalized into this shape** by the resolver (e.g. `schema_dir` ← first schema-config `discovery_rules` directory; `data_dir` ← `folder_creation` entry named `data` or native default).

### 20.3 Success Criteria

- [x] `common/library/paths/resolver.py` exists with `resolve_paths()` + `ResolvedPaths`; handles EKS `global_paths` and DCC shape.
- [x] `common/library/paths/__init__.py` exports `resolve_paths`, `ResolvedPaths`.
- [x] EKS `ConfigRegistry` + `phase1_server.py` route path access through the resolver; all 6 paths uniform.
- [x] `common/universal_pipeline_architecture_design.md` has L16 (§2.2/§2.3/§2.4) + §3.18 Path Resolution Pattern + §4.1/§9/§10 updates.
- [x] `eks/knowledge.json` updated with L16 status.
- [x] `eks_base_schema.json`/`eks_setup_schema.json`/`eks_config.json` have `workflow_files`/`tool_files` blocks; `global_paths` drives folder creation (no separate `folder_creation` block).
- [x] `setup_validator.py`/`config_registry.py` consume `workflow_files`/`tool_files` and auto-create dirs via resolver.
- [x] `eks/test/test_path_resolver.py` + `workflow_files`/`tool_files` schema tests added; full EKS suite 252/252 green (243 + 9 new).
- [x] I089 closed, I090 closed in issue log.

## 21. Pipeline Entry-Point & Per-Phase Sub-Pipeline Convergence (I092 / R60)

**Objective**: Resolve I092 by converging EKS pipeline entry points on a shared `run_pipeline(context)` funnel (mirroring DCC's CLI + UI + web → one `run_engine_pipeline(context)`) and satisfying R60 / AGENTS.md §18.13 — every phase (1–5) runs as an independent sub-pipeline with its own `phase{N}_server.py` backend. Phase 1 already has `phase1_server.py`; it needs the convergence cleanup. Phases 2–5 need the full backend + runner.

| T5.22 | 5 | Phase 5 proxy wiring | `serve.py` proxies `/api/v5/*` → port 5005. | 🔷 PLANNED | I092, T5.21 |

### 21.2 Success Criteria

- [x] Shared `run_pipeline(context)` helper exists and is called by Phase 1 CLI + `phase1_server`.
- [x] EKS CLI (`eks-pipeline`) runs the full pipeline end-to-end.
- [x] `phase1_server._run` calls `run_full_pipeline()` (no inline A→C); 409 + `resolve_paths()` preserved.
- [x] `engine_endpoints.py` removed; `eks/serve.py` present (§18.12).
- [x] `ConfigRegistry` SSOT passed at entry.
- [ ] Phases 2–5 each have a standalone `phase{N}_server.py` + `run_phase{N}_pipeline(context)`; `serve.py` proxies `/api/v{N}/*`.
- [x] Full EKS suite green (257/257).
