## 2. Project Knowledge Base

1. Project Knowledge Base will explain how a project is planned and implemented. It will be used by team for maintainance, troubleshooting, furture development with AI assistance. The main purpose is not for human consumption but for AI assistance and automation. It essentially serves as the machine-readable `software blueprint and project charter`.
2. Each project will contain following entities:
- folders and files
- modules, engines, clasess, tests, functions with codes
- schema files and environment for project setups
- input data
- output data
- user interface
- documentation for workplan, test reprots, logs
3. entities will have:
- metadata: such as name, version, date, description, purpose
- logics and relationships: such as dependencies, relationships, intergration points, workflows, functions, data flows, etc.
- actions: such as tests, workflows, functions, etc.
- permissions: such as boundaries, domains area, etc
4. Each project must maintain a `knowledge.json` file at the project root containing:

- **Project metadata**: name, version, description, purpose
- **Architecture overview**: key modules, data flows, integration points
- **Domain concepts**: core entities, relationships, terminology
- **Key schemas**: references to primary schema files (from `config/`)
- **Workflows**: primary operational workflows and entry points
- **Functions**: primary functions, entry points, data processing pipelines
- **Data flows**: data flow diagrams, data flow details, data quality checks
- **Dependencies**: external services, libraries, infrastructure
- **Known issues**: technical debt, limitations, open questions

**Location**: `<project>/knowledge.json`
**Schema**: Defined in `config/schemas/knowledge_base_schema.json` (shared)

5. Automated troubleshooting agent must manage the project effectively:
- automated root-cause analysis (RCA)
- Automomous Testing Execution (ATE)
- Change Impact Traveability (CIT)

## 3. Shared Configuration

A shared `config/` folder exists at the repository root for cross-project schemas and configuration:

```
config/
  schemas/           # Shared schema definitions (e.g., knowledge_base_schema.json)
```

## 4. Key Commands

```bash
# code_tracer — install and run
pip install ./code_tracer/engine
code-tracer /path/to/project
python code_tracer/engine/launch.py /path/to/project

# code_tracer — Docker
TARGET_DIR=/path/to/project docker compose -f code_tracer/engine/docker-compose.yml up

# code_tracer — tests (unittest)
python -m pytest code_tracer/engine/tests/

# code_tracer — frontend
cd code_tracer/engine/frontend && npm start
npm test  # React tests

# EKS — tests (pytest, must run from repo root)
python -m pytest eks/test/

# EKS — environment
conda env create -f eks/eks.yml
conda activate eks
```

## 5. Critical Workflow Rules (from `agent_rule.md`)

1. **Plan before code**: Always create a workplan, wait for approval, then implement.
2. **Archive before delete**: Move files to `archive/` before removing.
3. **Log everything**: Issues → `issue_log.md`, updates → `update_log.md`, tests → `test_log.md`.
4. **Workplan required**: Every task gets a workplan in `<project>/workplan/`. Update it as work proceeds.
5. **Test reports after phases**: Generate test reports in `<project>/workplan/reports/` after each workplan phase.
6. **Revision control**: Every file carries revision metadata (number, date, author, summary).
7. **Review related workplans** before starting any implementation.
8. **Messaging and errors**: All modules, engines, functions must utilize messaging and error logging to report status, errors, warnings and issues for data quality and data integrity, and healthyness of coding execution.
9. **Knowledge base required**: Every project must have a `knowledge.json` at root. Update it when architecture, schemas, or key workflows change.

## 6. Folder Convention (all projects)

Each project must use this subfolder layout:

```
archive/    config/     data/       output/     test/
ui/         engine/     log/        docs/       workplan/
knowledge.json          # Required at project root
```

Do not add unexpected top-level directories.

## 7. Files and Context

When scanning code for context, ignore:
- Files under any `backup/` folder
- Dot-folders and dot-files (`.git`, `.vscode`, etc.)
- Markdown files (`.md`) not in `workplan` folder
- Test folders

Also include:
- `<project>/knowledge.json` — project knowledge base (high priority)

## 8. Data Column Priority (EKS / dcc)

When processing tabular data:

**Rules:**
- No sorting before forward fill.
- Forward fill must never overwrite existing values.
- Always check for duplicate columns in the data frame.

**Priority order:**
1. **Priority 1 — Meta columns** (such as Project_Code, Department, etc.): forward-fill first. Null-handling must be "bounded" (stop if row index jumps or new file starts).
2. **Priority 2 — Relational keys** (such as Document_ID, Revision, etc.): validate, never blind-fill. If `Document_Revision` is null, trigger a lookup or flag a validation error.
3. **Priority 3 — Derived columns** (such as Submission_Closed, Days_Overdue, etc.): recalculate every run. Never have manual data.

**Processing sequence:**
1. Impute Priority 1: such as fill missing Project/Session info to anchor rows.
2. Validate Priority 2: such as ensure every document has an ID and a Revision.
3. Calculate Priority 3: such as run logic from `submission_closed_schema.json`.

## 9. Schema Pattern

Schemas follow a 3-layer inheritance model:
- `*_base_schema.json` — shared `definitions`
- `*_setup_schema.json` — `properties` and `$ref` to base
- `*_config.json` — actual values

Three parallel schema sets: **core** (eks_*), **asset** (eks_asset_*), **ontology** (eks_ontology_*).

**Schema rules:**
- Flat structure; use array of objects, avoid array of lists.
- Use `definitions` for repetitive objects.
- `additionalProperties: false` on important property controls.
- Define `required` for properties if applicable.
- Each schema file must have `$schema`, `$id`, `title`, `description`, `version`, `allof`, `$ref` calls if applicable.
- Schema loader must support all `$ref` types: string, object, nested object, recursive.
- Use Unified Schema Registry (URIs) — every schema gets a unique permanent `$id`.
- Pattern-based discovery for organizing schema files.

**Fragment pattern (asset):** Asset types compose schema fragments defined in `eks_asset_base_schema.json` (13 fragments: item_core, process_conditions, manufacturer, etc.). Conditional fragments bind to `device_type_code` values.

## 10. Module Design

- Module design for all functions and classes.
- `__init__.py` shall only contain import statements and version information.
- SSOT (Single Source of Truth) for all global parameters, variables, keys, codes, values, names, paths, files that outlive a single function.
- Schema-driven design for global parameters that outlive a single function.

## 11. Function Coding

- Every function gets a standardized docstring explaining purpose, parameters, and return values.
- Breadcrumb comments tracing parameter flow.

## 12. Debugging (agent_rule.md Section 6)

**Tiered logging** (categorized by severity):
- Level 0: silent / only errors
- Level 1: status/info — milestone progress, high-level workflow status, system snapshot
- Level 2: warning/debug — warnings, variable values, path resolutions
- Level 3: trace — OS-specific path slashes, JSON raw extraction, deep technical info

**Debug Object:** Collect all debug info into a single dict, save to `debug_log.json`, pass to `format_report`, print at end of workflow.

**Trace table:** Track parameter flow, resolved values, source, and status. Add timestamp/duration for each step.

**Print formatting:** Indent messages per hierarchy level of calling functions. Use a global depth counter that increments on entry, decrements on exit.

**Messages:** Always include function name or module name and calling context in warning/debug/trace messages.

**Global parameter tracing:** Log state before and after every major transformation.

**Fail-fast:** Implement fail-fast metadata in functions to stop execution on critical errors.

## 13. Revision Control

Apply revision control to every file created or modified:

- **All files:** Include revision number, date, summary of change, and author.
- **Markdown/docs:** Top-of-file revision table with `Revision`, `Date`, `Author`, `Summary`.
- **Code files:** Header comment block or module docstring with revision metadata.
- **Config/schema files:** Standard metadata fields (`version`, `title`, `description`, `revisionHistory`) plus comments if necessary.
- **Log updates:** Update `update_log.md` in the project `log/` folder on every file revision.
- **Archiving:** Preserve revision entries when archiving or renaming; archived files retain history.
- **Numbering:** Use consistent semantics (e.g. `0.1`, `1.0`, `1.1`, `2.0`); increment for each substantive update.

## 14. Documentation

Documentation must include all that apply:
1. Overall summary
2. Content index
3. Key features
4. Documentation map
5. Quick start and Mermaid workflow/chart
6. Module/function structure
7. List of functions
8. I/O table
9. Global Parameter Trace Matrix
10. Details of each function/module
11. Debugging and troubleshooting
12. Usage examples
13. Best practice and pending issues
14. Development test result
15. Dependencies and environment
16. Coding/programming engineering standard achieved

## 15. Workplan

Every task gets a workplan in `<project>/workplan/`:

**Required sections:**
- Title and description
- Document ID, revision control, version history, status
- Object
- Scope summary (ID, details, category, status, related phase)
- Index of content with links
- Dependencies with other tasks
- Evaluation and alignment with existing architecture
- Implementation phases with task breakdown, each containing:
  - Timeline, milestones, deliverables
  - What will be updated/created
  - Risks and mitigation
  - Potential future issues
  - Success criteria
  - References (files, reports, code)

**Rules:**
- Always update the workplan when there are changes.
- Always review related workplans before starting implementation.
- Always log issues to `issue_log.md` under the workplan's parent folder.
- Always generate a report per phase in `<project>/workplan/reports/`.
- Always update logs in `<project>/log/`.
- Timestamp all phases and steps.

## 16. Test Reports

Test reports go in `<project>/workplan/reports/` after each workplan phase:

**Required sections:**
- Title and description
- Document ID, revision control, version history, status
- Index of content with links
- Test objective, scope, execution summary
- Test methodology, environment, tools
- Test phases, steps, cases, status, detailed results
- Test success criteria and checklist
- Files archived, modified, version controlled
- Recommendations for future actions
- Lessons learned

**Rules:**
- Log issues to `issue_log.md` under the workplan's parent folder.
- Update `update_log.md` in `<project>/log/`.
- Cross-reference reports to workplan files.
- Timestamp all phases and steps.

## 17. Function Table and Call Graph

When documenting modules, provide:
- All functions in a module/engine/class
- Function calling sequence
- Function description and purpose
- Function parameters (in) and return values (out)
- Function dependencies and relationships
- Function error/exception handling
- Function tracing and status reporting
- Function UI and interaction

## 18. UI Web Design

All HTML files must follow these rules:

**Dependencies:**
- Interactive standalone webpage design.
- Separate independent CSS file per project.
- Schema-driven.

**Layout (VS Code style):**
- Title/menu bar spanning full width (theme button, layout button, menu, global search).
- Side icon bar panel (left) — icons only; left panel icons on top, right panel icons at bottom with divider.
- Toggleable left sidebar — collapsible, resizable by dragging right edge, content toggleable.
- Toggleable right sidebar — collapsible, resizable by dragging left edge, anchored to screen right.
- Bottom status bar showing selected file.

**Theme:**
- Toggle via button in top-right of title bar.
- Options: light (bright bg), dark (dark bg), sky (sky blue), ocean (ocean blue), presentation (light grey).
- Save theme selection in localStorage.

**Layout switching:**
- Layout button in title bar switches between single column, two columns, three columns, etc.

**File loading panel:**
- Load files from local disk or specific pipeline files.
- List all loaded files.
- Drag-and-drop to load.
- Collapsible via side icon bar.

**Tree selection panel:**
- Show hierarchical structure of loaded content.
- Select any node to show content in main panel.
- Expand all / collapse all.

**Icons (Unicode):**
- Info: ℹ️
- File load: 📂
- Help: ❓
- Setting: ⚙️
- Tree: 🌳

**Help system:**
- Store help text, about text, revision text, default file names/folders/definitions in `ui_help.json`.
- HTML files load values from this JSON file.

## 19. Data Health, Score, and Errors

Each business logic must have an independent error code defined to trace related errors.

## 20. Neurogram, Compact Workplans, Records, and Logs for Knowledge of Each Project Folder

Refer to `dcc/workplan/ui_design/log_neurogram/`. Generate a neurogram network JSON file (`dcc_log_graph.json`) in the respective `<project>/output/` folder. Ensure details can be compacted into the JSON file.

## 21. Testing Notes

- `code_tracer` tests use `unittest`; `eks` tests use `pytest`.
- EKS tests expect config files at `eks/config/` (relative to repo root).
- EKS tests create/clean `eks/test_output/` and `eks/output/eks_registry.db`.
- code_tracer tests use `unittest.main()` and can be run directly or via pytest.

## 22. Formatting

- Prettier config at root: `printWidth: 100`, `singleQuote: true`, `endOfLine: "lf"`.
