## 2. Title and Description

Establish the EKS project foundation and the canonical, schema-driven pipeline substrate that all subsequent phases build upon. This phase creates the bedrock that all subsequent phases build upon.

Deliverables:
- AGENTS.md-compliant project folder structure and conda environment
- Canonical 3-layer schema design (base/setup/config) across core, asset, and ontology sets — including the universal plant-item asset schema with 13 reusable fragments and zero-code extensibility, ISO 15926 ontology integration, and the enhanced document schema v2 with type/file/element registries
- Schema-driven SSOT global parameters and universal system parameters (runtime behavior config)
- Document ingestion plug-ins for PDF/DOCX/XLSX plus a DuckDB-backed document registry with full CRUD and revision management (preserve-all revisions + latest-revision flag)
- Tiered logging (levels 0–3), debug object, and structured trace table, along with a schema-driven error/message catalog and per-document 6-dimension health scoring
- The end-to-end discovery → register → route → parse → detect → score → review pipeline (auto-DDL generation, file scanner, parser router, orchestrator with rollback, manual review workflow)
- Universal path resolution and a converged pipeline entry point (CLI + web + per-phase HTTP backend) funneling through a shared `run_pipeline(context)` / `bootstrap_pipeline()` helper
- Initiation integrity, config flattening, cross-cutting remediation, and architectural patterns (BaseEngine, Validator, factories, setup validation, data_dir traversal guard)

## 3. Revision Control & Version History

| Version | Date       | Author | Summary of Changes                            |
| :------ | :--------- | :----- | :-------------------------------------------- |
| 3.55    | 2026-07-11 | opencode | **Canonical workplan promotion**: Retired pre-restructure body (v3.52) to `eks/archive/phase_1_foundation_workplan_v3.52.md` per AGENTS.md archive-before-delete. Promoted restructured workplan as canonical `phase_1_foundation_workplan.md`; removed interim draft filename. |
| 3.54    | 2026-07-11 | opencode | **Section resequence**: Index retained at §1; Revision History moved to §3. Renumbered design/feature block §7b–§7n → §11–§23. Shifted late-phase work §10–§16 → §24–§30; closing sections §17–§20 → §31–§34; References §22 → §35. Updated Master Task Index Owner Section column, Index anchors, and active § cross-references. |
| 3.53    | 2026-07-11 | opencode | **Workplan restructure — tasks relocated to topical sections**: The canonical §8 Task Breakdown is now a **Master Task Index** (ID \| Task \| Owner Section \| Status, 143 rows) — task *definitions* are no longer duplicated there. All 81 early Phase 1 tasks (T1.1–T1.76) moved into 10 topical sections with their own Task Breakdown tables (later renumbered §11–§23 in v3.54). Late tasks (T1.77–T1.99 + Phase 2–5 convergence T2.25–T5.22) remain defined in initiation/convergence sections (later §24–§30). No task is defined in two places. |
| 3.52    | 2026-07-11 | opencode | **Workplan audit & gap remediation (G1–G4 + color key)**: Re-audited all Phase 1 tasks against code. G3 — corrected §8 status column for T1.69/T1.70/T1.72/T1.73/T1.75/T1.76 (severity emojis 🟠/🔴/🟡 → ✅; all six verified implemented). G1 — reclassified T1.56 (CLI Entry Points) to 🔶 PARTIAL: only `eks/engine/parsers/cli.py` is real (T1.99b); `eks/engine/core/discovery_cli.py` + `health_cli.py` are stubs returning placeholder SUCCESS (no standalone discovery/health engines built) — tracked as I093. G2 — T1.57 detail corrected: HTTP API is `eks/ui/backend/phase1_server.py`; `engine_endpoints.py` archived in T1.99d. G4 — §9 files table corrected: `project_setup.json` Create→Deleted (T1.67); `engine_endpoints.py`→`phase1_server.py` (archived); discovery/health CLI paths fixed to `engine/core/`. Color key — §14 Mermaid: ENTRY nodes ECLI/EWEB/ERUN were styled amber while labeled ✅ COMPLETE; recoloured to green; legend text tidied to "🔶 Partial / Planned"; §4 Status Legend aligned to "✅ PASS / COMPLETE | 🔶 PARTIAL | ❌ FAIL | 🔷 PLANNED" and notes severity emojis are not status values. Top status notes T1.56 partial. |
| 3.51    | 2026-07-11 | opencode | **T1.99a–g COMPLETE (I092 / R60)**: Implemented Phase 1 entry-point convergence. T1.99a — new `eks/engine/core/pipeline_runner.py` with `bootstrap_pipeline()` + `run_pipeline(context)` (ConfigRegistry → SchemaLoader.load_all → DocumentRegistry → ErrorManager/MessageManager → ProjectSetupValidator readiness gate → PipelineOrchestrator.run_full_pipeline → checkpoint + on_phase callback). T1.99b — `eks/engine/parsers/cli.py` rewritten as real end-to-end CLI + `eks/pyproject.toml` `eks-pipeline` console_scripts. T1.99c — `phase1_server._run` wired to `run_pipeline()` (409 guard + resolve_paths preserved). T1.99d — orphan `ui/backend/engine_endpoints.py` archived to `archive/ui/backend/` (no references). T1.99e — canonical `eks/serve.py` added (§18.12); `server.py` becomes thin re-export shim. T1.99f — `bootstrap_pipeline()` uses `ConfigRegistry` singleton SSOT (resets singleton when a different config_dir is requested to avoid test pollution; soft readiness gate logs + continues even when `fail_fast:true`). T1.99g — new `eks/test/test_pipeline_runner.py` (CLI smoke + run_pipeline exercised); fixed `project_root` depth bug (`parent×4`) in cli.py + pipeline_runner.py; fixed `phase1_server._run` cancellation bug — a cancelled job previously had its `"cancelled"` status overwritten with `"failed"` when the running thread caught the `Pipeline cancelled` RuntimeError, making `test_pipeline_cancel` flaky; cancellation now preserves `"cancelled"` status and logs as STATUS not ERROR. Full EKS suite 257/257 green (stable across repeated runs). I092 narrowed to remaining Phases 2–5. U139. |
| 3.50    | 2026-07-11 | opencode | **§14 architecture diagram — three entry points (I092 / R60)**: Added `ENTRY` subgraph to the §14 Mermaid diagram showing three pipeline entry points — ① CLI (`eks/engine/cli.py`, T1.99b 🔷 PLANNED), ② Web (`eks/serve.py`, T1.99e 🔷 PLANNED), ③ HTTP Backend (`phase1_server.py`, ✅ exists, T1.99c) — all converging on a shared `run_pipeline(context)`/`bootstrap_pipeline()` helper (T1.99a 🔷 PLANNED) which feeds into the Bootstrap subgraph. Planned nodes colour-coded amber. Doc-only change. |
| 3.49    | 2026-07-11 | opencode | **T1.99a–g PLANNED (I092 / R60)**: Added §21 Pipeline Entry-Point & Per-Phase Sub-Pipeline Convergence. Proposed extracting shared `run_pipeline(context)`/`bootstrap_pipeline()` helper (T1.99a), unified CLI + `console_scripts` (T1.99b), wiring `phase1_server._run` to `run_full_pipeline` (T1.99c), deleting orphan `engine_endpoints.py` (T1.99d), adding `eks/serve.py` (T1.99e), `ConfigRegistry` SSOT at entry (T1.99f), tests (T1.99g). Per-phase backend tasks added to Phases 2–5 (T2.25–T2.26, T3.36–T3.37, T4.26–T4.27, T5.21–T5.22). All 🔷 PLANNED for review. No implementation. |
| 3.48    | 2026-07-11 | opencode | **Workplan diagram consistency fix**: Corrected §14 Bootstrap Mermaid subgraph stale markers — nodes I72A/I72B (T1.72), CKPT (T1.73), M75 (T1.75), M76 (T1.76) were labelled 🔷/🔶 "pending"/amber although completed in v3.29; recoloured to ✅ green and updated legend node L2 to a generic amber color key. No task status changed — all Phase 1 tasks remain ✅. |
| 3.47    | 2026-07-11 | opencode | **T1.98 COMPLETE**: §20 Universal Path Resolution & Schema-Driven Initialization (I089 + I090). Adopted EKS `global_paths` as universal canonical path pattern (L16) via new `common/library/paths/resolver.py` (`resolve_paths`, `ResolvedPaths`) normalizing EKS + DCC shapes; wired `ConfigRegistry` + `phase1_server.py`; added `workflow_files`/`tool_files` to EKS schema + config (`workflow_file_entry_def`/`tool_file_entry_def`) for DCC parity; `setup_validator.py` validates them; `folder_creation` satisfied by canonical `global_paths`. Universal architecture doc L16 + §3.18 + §2.2/§2.3/§2.4/§4.1/§4.2/§9/§10. `eks/knowledge.json` v2.6.0. 252/252 tests pass. I089 + I090 closed. |
| 3.46    | 2026-07-11 | Codex | **Universal Architecture Elevation (T1.97j–n/I091) COMPLETE**: `system_parameters` elevated to universal L15; `config` registered in `common/library/__init__.py`; universal architecture doc updated (L15, §3.17, §4.1/§4.2/§9/§10); `eks/knowledge.json` → v2.5.0. Full EKS suite 243/243 green. I091 closed. |
| 3.45    | 2026-07-11 | Codex | **T1.97 COMPLETE**: Implemented universal system parameter helpers, schema/config blocks, runtime wiring, focused tests, logs, report update, and I088 closure. Full EKS suite 243/243 pass. |
| 3.44    | 2026-07-10 | opencode | **T1.97 (PLANNED)**: Added §19 System Parameters — SSOT Centralization. Universal `get_system_param()` in `common/library/config/`; `system_parameters_def` in `eks_base_schema.json`; `system_parameters` block in `eks_config.json`; replace hardcoded values in `phase1_server.py`, `error_manager.py`, `registry.py`, `server.py`. Phase status set to 🔶 PARTIAL. Updated index, revision table, §5. |
| 3.43    | 2026-07-10 | opencode | **T1.96f COMPLETE**: Fixed discovery-driven schema loading — added `*_base.json` discovery rule to catch `eks_error_code_base.json` and `eks_message_base.json` (missed by `*_base_schema.json` pattern). All 236/236 tests green. Updated §18 statuses. Phase 1 foundation marked ✅ COMPLETE. |
| 3.42    | 2026-07-10 | opencode | **Schema Discovery & Registration (T1.96)**: Added §18. Extract `discover_schema_files()` from DCC `ref_resolver.py` into `common/` as shared function; add `discovery_rules` data to `eks_config.json`; refactor `schema_loader.py` to use config-driven loading (explicit + discovery); wire `ValidationManager.validate_discovery_rules()` in `setup_validator.py`. Updated §5 index, §18, §19. Logged I087–I090. |
| 3.41    | 2026-07-09 | opencode | **Initiation Config Flattening (T1.90–T1.95)**: Added §17. Flatten `project_setup` from `eks_config.json` to top-level (DCC `project_config` pattern); update `eks_setup_schema.json` (drop wrapper, v1.5.0); make `setup_validator.py` + `phase1_server.py` flatten-aware with `project_setup` backward-compat fallback; delete orphan `eks_project_setup_config.json` (archived); update tests; full suite green. |
| 3.40    | 2026-07-09 | opencode | **Consolidated + COMPLETE**: Restored pre-truncation workplan body (v3.29) and integrated Phase 1.3 (T1.84–T1.89) Initiation Schema & Validation Harmonization into §16. Added §15 Initiation Integrity & Hardening (T1.77–T1.83) summary referencing `phase_1_t179_t183_report.md`. Phase status set to ✅ COMPLETE through T1.89 (235/235 tests pass). Phase 1.3 stand-alone workplan archived in `eks/archive/`. |
| 3.29    | 2026-07-08 | opencode | Expanded Bootstrap closure scope: added T1.75 (activate ErrorManager/MessageManager in phase1_server — closes silent T1.68 gap where managers were never passed to the running server) and T1.76 (persist debug_log.json + message/status JSON to `eks/output/` per AGENTS.md §7/§19). Updated T1.69 (run_id correlation) and T1.73 (checkpoint to `eks/output/checkpoints/{job_id}.json`). Updated §4 scope, §8 task table, §9 files table, §14 Mermaid, and test report. |
| 3.28    | 2026-07-08 | opencode | Implemented T1.68 (wired ErrorManager/MessageManager into PipelineOrchestrator), T1.71 (added update_document_status + _with_retry to registry), T1.74 (anchored phase1_server paths to PRJ_DIR, EKSPaths.to_dict uses .asposix()). Fixed pre-existing get_document() bug. Added 7 new tests. 191/191 tests pass. |
| 3.27    | 2026-07-08 | System | Added `Related Tasks` column to §4 Scope Summary table and `Scope` column to §8 Task Breakdown table with full cross-references; added R99 Foundation & Compliance scope entry. |
| 3.26    | 2026-07-08 | System | Appended a new revision entry to the history and documented the shared common-library architecture milestone under `common/library` as a follow-on foundation item for future EKS integration work. |
| 3.25    | 2026-07-08 | System | Added note that shared common-library package structure under `common/library` now exists for architecture-aligned logging, telemetry, pipeline, errors, messages, paths, validation, UI, and factory modules; documented as a reusable foundation for future EKS integration work. |
| 3.24    | 2026-07-08 | System | Added T1.68–T1.73: wire ErrorManager/MessageManager into orchestrator (T1.68), add run_id correlation ID to EKSLogger (T1.69), add data_dir traversal guard to phase1_server.py (T1.70), replace raw duckdb.connect in _update_doc_status with registry method (T1.71), enforce DiscoveryInput/Output and ParserInput/Output contracts in orchestrator phases (T1.72), persist checkpoint JSON to disk in _run() thread (T1.73). |
| 3.23    | 2026-07-08 | System | Added T1.74 (cross-platform path compatibility) addressing 4 gaps: unanchored relative paths in phase1_server.py, backslash paths in _handle_config_paths, EKSPaths.to_dict() using str() not as_posix(), and context.py checkpoint serialization. |
| 3.22 | 2026-07-01 | opencode | Enhanced §14 Mermaid diagram with explicit function call annotations per pipeline step. Added §14.1 Function Table (11 module tables) per AGENTS.md §17 — covers all pipeline-critical functions with description, parameters, return values, dependencies, error handling, and tracing. |
| 3.21 | 2026-06-30 | opencode | T1.67 complete: Added 4 defs to `eks_base_schema.json` v1.6.0; added `project_setup` property to `eks_setup_schema.json` v1.3.0; added values to `eks_config.json` v1.4.0; archived `project_setup.json`; refactored `setup_validator.py` to load from ConfigRegistry. I046 resolved. 118/118 tests pass. Phase 1 COMPLETE. |
| 3.20 | 2026-06-30 | opencode | Added T1.67: Integrate `project_setup.json` into core eks_base/setup/config schemas per AGENTS.md §9 3-layer pattern. Logged I046. Phase 1 status set to PARTIAL pending review. |
| 3.19 | 2026-06-30 | System | Completed Appendix F architecture integration tasks T1.52-T1.66: Implemented EKSPipelineContext, BaseEngine, TelemetryHeartbeat, Multi-Stage Validation, CLI Entry Points, HTTP API Endpoints, Checkpoint State Serialization, Factories (ParserFactory, HealthScorerFactory, StructureDetectorFactory), updated ParserRouter to use factories, enhanced PipelineOrchestrator with checkpoints and rollback, implemented Project Setup Validator and schema. Phase 1 status COMPLETE. |
| 3.18 | 2026-06-30 | opencode | Migrated Section 16 (I/O Contract tasks) to phase_1.2_interactive_ui_workplan.md as Phase 1.2.0. Removed section from this workplan. Updated index and renumbered Section 17→16. |
| 3.17 | 2026-06-30 | opencode | Fixed 3 issues: (1) Phase status changed from COMPLETE to PARTIAL reflecting T1.52-T1.66 pending; (2) T1.35.1-T1.35.5 sub-task statuses corrected to match actual implementation (3x ✅, 2x 🔶); (3) Removed `$schema` from `eks_error_config.json` and `eks_message_config.json` (violated `additionalProperties: false` in setup schemas, breaking all 63 phase 1 tests). System back to 118/118 tests pass. I045 resolved. |
| 3.16 | 2026-06-29 | System | Refactored Phase 1.2 scope: kept only I/O check, test, and UI design tasks (T1.2.1-T1.2.5). Moved unrelated Appendix F architecture tasks (PipelineContext, Dependency Injection, Telemetry, etc.) to Phase 1 main task breakdown as T1.52-T1.66. Updated Files and Modules section accordingly. |
| 3.15 | 2026-06-26 | Cascade | Added Section 16: Phase 1.2 Foundation Enhancement (Future Work) with 19 tasks for applying universal pipeline architecture patterns (PipelineContext, Dependency Injection, Phase-Based Orchestration, Telemetry Heartbeat, Standardized Engine I/O, UI Contracts, Project Setup Validation). Tasks derived from Appendix F. Updated Section 5 index to include new section. |
| 3.14 | 2026-06-25 | opencode | Integrated full Schema Inheritance Chain from `schema_inheritance_chain.md` (v1.11) into `appendix_e_schema_design.md` (v0.6) as E11–E12. Updated E1 (23 files, asset_context), E2 Mermaid (14 fragments), E5.1/5.3 (14 fragments, 55 base defs). Archived `schema_inheritance_chain.md` → `archive/`. U089 logged. |
| 3.13 | 2026-06-25 | opencode | T1.51 implemented: `asset_context` fragment added to all 3 asset schema files (base 1.3.0, setup 1.3.0, config 1.4.0) with extensible location_hierarchy (`additionalProperties: true`), extensible system_hierarchy (`additionalProperties: true`), project_context, asset_relationships, document_relationships, lifecycle_context. Location as link context (no keytag). Updated schema_inheritance_chain.md v1.11. Updated tests: 118/118 pass. Phase 1 marked COMPLETE. |
| 3.12 | 2026-06-24 | opencode | T1.50: Base schema SSOT enforcement — stripped `document_relationship_trigger_map` to shape-only (U086); moved `revision_id` to doc schema set + added `revision_validation` 3-layer chain (U087); removed `revision_pattern` from `project_rules`. Updated `ConfigRegistry` to resolve `$ref` entries on-the-fly. I031–I032 resolved. 114/114 tests pass. |
| 3.11 | 2026-06-24 | opencode | T1.49: Cross-cutting workplan remediation — replaced `agent_rule.md` with `AGENTS.md` across 11 files; converted Linux absolute paths to relative; fixed stale statuses; reordered master sections; fixed Phase 2 dates; filled Phase 3 gaps; added reranker criteria and eval metrics to Phase 4; resolved frontend tech, auth note, expanded Mermaid for Phase 5. |
| 3.10 | 2026-06-24 | opencode | Consolidated T1.30–T1.32 test report into `phase_1_foundation_report.md` (v1.4). Removed `phase_1_t130_t132_report.md`. Updated deliverable list to reflect consolidation. |
| 3.9     | 2026-06-23 | opencode | Three optional fixes: (1) I027 — aligned error/message base schema URIs to filename-based pattern; (2) Consolidated `verbosity_level` enum into shared `eks_base_schema.json#/definitions/verbosity_level`; (3) Added shared `document_relationship_trigger_map` def — both asset and doc configs now `$ref` it. Added `base_schema` to all validation registries in `schema_loader.py` and tests. I027 resolved, I028 updated. Bumped 6 file versions. 114/114 tests pass. |
| 3.8     | 2026-06-23 | opencode | T1.48 complete: fixed duplicate defs, parser paths, missing parsers. Reverted metadata fields from config files (broke `additionalProperties: false` validation). Logged I028. All 114 tests pass. |
| 3.7     | 2026-06-23 | opencode | Added T1.48: Schema audit — duplicate defs, parser path mismatch, missing parsers, missing `$schema` in error/message configs. Logged I022–I027. |
| 3.6     | 2026-06-23 | opencode | Added T1.41–T1.47 to task list (§8): error/message schema fix, 4 fragment schemas (project, discipline, department, facility), base schema definitions, config/setup updates, validation tests. Updated §9 files table (+15 entries). Updated §12 success criteria (+13 items). Updated §13 deliverables (+6 items). Test count: 53 → 59. Schema count: 17 → 21. I005 resolved. |
| 3.5     | 2026-06-23 | opencode | Added §12 success criteria: data challenges documented (I015–I021), DGN gap identified as risk. Added §13 deliverable: data challenge analysis. |

## 6. Evaluation and Alignment with Existing Architecture

- **Schema pattern**: Directly adopts `project_setup_base.json / project_setup.json / project_config.json` from `dcc/config/schemas`
- **Logging**: Directly adopts tiered logging and debug object from `dcc/workflow/core_engine/` patterns
- **Module design**: SSOT global parameters via schema-driven config per AGENTS.md Section 4
- **New**: Document registry with metadata DB is new to this workspace; no prior precedent in DCC

---

## 7. Dependencies with Other Tasks

1. **AGENTS.md** — Governs all coding standards, module design, logging
2. **dcc/config/schemas** — Schema base/setup/config pattern to replicate
3. **External**: DuckDB (preferred for dev) or PostgreSQL for metadata DB
4. **Next Phase**: Phase 2 depends on document registry and parsers from this phase

## 11. Proposed Project Folder Structure

The EKS project folder follows the standard structure defined in `AGENTS.md`. All folders are created in Phase 1 (T1.1) as empty scaffolding so subsequent phases can populate them without restructuring.

**Notes:**
- Folders for all phases (chunking, embedding, graph, retrieval, cache, ui) are created as **empty scaffolding** in Phase 1 (T1.1) to establish the full layout upfront
- Each phase populates only its designated folders; no folder restructuring is needed later
- `data/` is for raw input documents supplied by the user; not committed to version control
- `output/` holds runtime artifacts (debug logs, exported graphs); not committed to version control

## 12. Detailed Schema Design (T1.3 - T1.5)

Following the standards in `AGENTS.md` Section 2 (Schema Fragments & Inheritance) and Section 4 (SSOT), the EKS canonical schema is designed across three files to separate definitions, declarations, and actual values.

### T1.3: `eks_base_schema.json` (Definitions)
- **Purpose**: Store reusable fragments and type definitions (`definitions` or `$defs`).
- **Standard**: Flat structure, use array of objects, `additionalProperties: false`.
- **Key Definitions**:
    - `discipline_code`: Enum (PI, EL, IN, CI, ME, etc.) for engineering discipline identification.
    - `revision_id`: String with regex pattern (e.g., `^[A-Z0-9]{1,2}$`) for strict revision control.
    - `ProjectMetadata`: Shared fragment for project identification (title, number, area, discipline, department).
    - `DocumentMetadata`: Shared fragment for document identification (type, number, revision, status, latest_flag).
    - `EngineeringObject`: Fragment for engineering items (tag, object_type, properties dict).
    - `SourceTraceability`: Fragment for chunk source tracking (file_path, page, section, chunk_id).
        - **Asset Schema Fragments (R36, R39)** — 13 fragments for universal plant item schema (see [appendix_a_asset_schema.md](appendix_a_asset_schema.md)):
        - `item_core_def`, `process_conditions_def`, `manufacturer_def`, `asset_lifecycle_def`, `control_system_def`, `piping_connection_def`, `valve_internals_def`, `actuator_def` (full manufacturer+lifecycle block), `rotating_equipment_def`, `instrumentation_def`, `pipeline_route_def`, `specialist_equipment_def` (UV/filtration/conveyor), `motor_control_def` (starter type, MCC feed). `conditional_fragments` structure added for zero-code extensibility (R39).

### T1.4: `eks_setup_schema.json` (Declarations / Properties)
- **Purpose**: Define the structure and metadata of the system configuration (`properties`).
- **Standard**: One-to-one match with `eks_base_schema.json` via `$ref`.
- **Sections**:
    - `global_paths`: Mandatory directory paths (data, output, archive, config).
    - `registry`: Metadata database configuration (type, connection_string, timeout).
    - `parsers`: Configuration for document parser plugins (enabled list, specific parser settings).
    - `embedding`: SSOT for embedding provider settings (active_provider, model_name, dimensions).
    - `vector_store`: Vector database configuration (qdrant_url, collection_name, distance_metric).
    - `graph_db`: Knowledge graph settings (neo4j_uri, credentials, relationship_labels).
    - `logging`: Tiered logging configuration (default_level, debug_file_path).
    - `asset_type_registry`: Tag-type-to-fragment mapping registry declaring which fragments compose each AT_ category.

### T1.5: `eks_config.json` (Actual Values / Config)
- **Purpose**: Store the actual runtime values used by the EKS engine.
- **Standard**: Validates strictly against `eks_setup_schema.json`.
- **Example SSOT Values**:
    - `registry.type`: "duckdb"
    - `registry.connection`: "output/eks_registry.db"
    - `embedding.active_provider`: "openai"
    - `vector_store.collection_name`: "eks_chunks"
    - `logging.default_level`: 1
    - `project_assets.WSD11.datadrop_path`: "data/twrp/datadrop/Datadrop Summary.xlsx"
    - `asset_type_registry.AT_EQUIP.fragments`: ["core", "process_conditions", "manufacturer", "asset_lifecycle", "control_system", "rotating_equipment"]

## 13. Independent Parser Module Architecture (T1.8 - T1.11)

To support diverse engineering document types (PDF, Word, Excel, AutoCAD, DGN) while maintaining system extensibility, EKS implements a **Plug-in Parser Architecture**.

### 1. The Parser Interface (`BaseParser`)
Every independent parser module must inherit from the `BaseParser` abstract class located in `engine/parsers/base_parser.py`.
- **`parse(file_path)`**: Returns a list of standardized content dictionaries.
- **`extract_metadata(file_path)`**: Returns file-level metadata (e.g., author, system properties).
- **`get_source_location(element_id)`**: Maps content back to its physical/logical source (e.g., page, sheet, layer, coordinates).

### 2. Standardized Output Format
Regardless of the file type, parsers must output a unified structure to prevent downstream logic pollution:
- **Textual Data**: Content string with associated formatting hints.
- **Structural Metadata**: Section headings, table identifiers, or sheet names.
- **Source Context**: Page numbers (PDF/DOCX), Cell references (XLSX), or Layer names/Coordinates (DWG/DGN).

### 3. Schema-Driven Discovery (SSOT)
Parsers are mapped to file extensions in `eks_config.json`. The EKS engine uses this mapping to dynamically instantiate the correct parser at runtime:
```json
"parsers": {
    ".pdf": "engine.parsers.pdf_parser.PDFParser",
    ".docx": "engine.parsers.docx_parser.DocxParser",
    ".xlsx": "engine.parsers.xlsx_parser.XlsxParser",
    ".dwg": "engine.parsers.dwg_parser.DWGParserStub",
    ".dgn": "engine.parsers.dgn_parser.DGNParserStub"
}
```

### 4. Implementation Strategy
- **Phase 1**: Full implementation of PDF, DOCX, and XLSX parsers.
- **CAD Support**: `DWGParserStub` and `DGNParserStub` will be created to define the interface requirements, returning "Format supported - Implementation Pending" for future Phase 3 integration.

## 14. Foundation, Environment & Compliance (R99)

Project scaffolding, conda environment, SSOT config registry, tests/logs, cross-cutting remediation, architectural base classes, setup validation, and cross-platform hardening.

### Task Breakdown

| # | Task | Details | Scope | Status | Related |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :---: | :--- |
| T1.1 | Create EKS folder structure | archive, config, data, output, engine, log, docs, workplan, test, ui | R99 | ✅ | — |
| T1.2 | Create environment file `eks.yml` | Conda environment with all Phase 1–5 dependencies (Python, DuckDB, FastAPI, parsers, vector DB, graph DB clients, embedding providers, rdflib for ontology OWL/Turtle file parsing) | R99 | ✅ | — |
| T1.14 | Implement SSOT config registry | Global parameter access via schema-driven config; no hardcoding | R06, R35 | ✅ | — |
| T1.15 | Write unit tests | Schema loader, document registry, revision management, parsers, logger | R99 | ✅ | — |
| T1.16 | Create log files | `update_log.md`, `issue_log.md` under `eks/log/` | R99 | ✅ | — |
| T1.33 | Migrate EKS schemas to config/schemas/ | Move core/asset/ontology config & schema files to `eks/config/schemas/`; update SchemaLoader, ErrorManager, MessageManager, tests, and documentation | R06, R99 | ✅ | 2026-06-22 |
| T1.48 | Schema audit — duplicates, inconsistencies, missing validations | (1) Remove duplicate `revision_id` and `discipline_code` from `eks_doc_base_schema.json`; (2) Align parser import paths (`engine.parsers.*` → `eks.engine.parsers.*`); (3) Add dgn/dwg stub parsers to `eks_config.json`; (4) Add `$schema` to `eks_error_config.json` and `eks_message_config.json` (reverted — broke `additionalProperties: false` validation); (5) Log all issues (I022–I028). All 114 tests pass. | R06, R99 | ✅ Complete | 2026-06-23 |
| T1.49 | Cross-cutting workplan remediation | Fix `agent_rule.md` references → `AGENTS.md`; convert Linux absolute paths to relative; update stale statuses (master DRAFT, T1.33, Appendix D); reorder §10/§25 in master; fix Phase 2 date ordering; fill Phase 3 placeholders (sections, tasks T3.1–T3.27); add reranker criteria and eval metrics to Phase 4; choose React for Phase 5 frontend, expand Mermaid diagram, add auth note. | R99 | ✅ Complete | 2026-06-24 |
| T1.52 | Implement EKSPipelineContext | Create `eks/engine/core/context.py` with nested dataclasses for centralized state management (paths, data, parameters, state, telemetry, schema_registry) per Appendix F | R57 | ✅ | 2026-06-30 |
| T1.53 | Implement BaseEngine abstract class | Create `eks/engine/core/base.py` with standard execution flow (validate → execute → validate) per Appendix F | R99 | ✅ | 2026-06-30 |
| T1.55 | Implement Multi-Stage Validation | Create `eks/engine/core/validator.py` with setup, schema, data, parser validation stages per Appendix F | R99 | ✅ | 2026-06-30 |
| T1.56 | Implement CLI Entry Points | Independent engine execution via command line per Appendix F. **Only `eks/engine/parsers/cli.py` is functional** (real end-to-end CLI + `eks-pipeline` console_scripts, delivered in T1.99b). `eks/engine/core/discovery_cli.py` and `eks/engine/core/health_cli.py` exist but are **stubs** — `run()` returns a placeholder `EngineOutput(status="SUCCESS")` with `TODO: Implement actual … execution`; no standalone discovery/health-scorer engines were ever built (discovery is part of the phase-1 orchestrator, health scoring runs inside it). No tests cover the two stub CLIs. | R99 | 🔶 PARTIAL | 2026-06-30 / 2026-07-11 |
| T1.57 | Implement HTTP API Endpoints | Independent engine execution via HTTP per Appendix F. **Delivered as `eks/ui/backend/phase1_server.py`** (standalone `--port 5001`, §18.13). The originally-cited `eks/ui/backend/engine_endpoints.py` was an orphaned stub and was **archived** to `archive/ui/backend/engine_endpoints.py` in T1.99d — it is no longer the HTTP entry point. | R99 | ✅ | 2026-06-30 / 2026-07-11 |
| T1.65 | Implement Project Setup Validator | Create `eks/engine/core/setup_validator.py` with auto-creation of missing folders per Appendix F | R99 | ✅ | 2026-06-30 |
| T1.66 | Create Project Setup Schema | Create `eks/config/schemas/project_setup.json` for setup validation per Appendix F | R99 | ✅ | 2026-06-30 |
| T1.67 | Integrate project_setup into core 3-layer schemas (I046) | Refactor `project_setup.json` content into `eks_base_schema.json` (4 new defs: `required_folder_setup_def`, `required_file_setup_def`, `environment_setup_def`, `validation_options_def`), `eks_setup_schema.json` (new `project_setup` property with `$ref`), and `eks_config.json` (actual values). Delete orphan `project_setup.json`. Refactor `setup_validator.py` to load from `ConfigRegistry` chain instead of hardcoded lists. Resolves I046. | R99 | ✅ | 2026-06-30 |
| T1.70 | Add data_dir traversal guard to phase1_server.py | In `_handle_files_load()` and `_handle_pipeline_start()`, resolve `data_dir` against `PRJ_DIR` and check `is_relative_to(PRJ_DIR)` — return HTTP 403 if outside project root. Mirrors the guard already present in `_handle_list_dirs()`. | R99 | ✅ | — |
| T1.74 | Cross-platform path compatibility | Fix 4 cross-platform gaps: (1) Anchor all bare relative paths in `phase1_server.py` `_run()` and `_handle_files_load()` to `PRJ_DIR` — `SchemaLoader(str(PRJ_DIR / "eks" / "config"))`, `orchestrator.initialize_context(data_dir=PRJ_DIR / data_dir, ...)`, `scanner.scan(PRJ_DIR / data_dir)`; (2) Fix `_handle_config_paths()` to return `as_posix()` strings instead of `str(Path)` which produces backslashes on Windows; (3) Fix `EKSPaths.to_dict()` in `context.py` to use `.as_posix()` for all path fields so checkpoint JSON is OS-portable; (4) Fix `EKSPipelineContext.from_dict()` to reconstruct `Path` objects from posix strings. Resolves I078–I081. | R99 | ✅ Done | T1.69, T1.70 |

| T1.13 | Implement tiered logger | `logger.py`: levels 0–3, debug object, trace table, depth counter | R33, R34 | ✅ | — |
| T1.30 | Error Code Taxonomy Schema | Create `eks/config/schemas/eks_error_code_base.json` (error code format definitions, severity levels, phase/module/function codes) and `eks/config/schemas/eks_error_config.json` (full system + data error catalog including structural error codes P3-E-E-0010–0017). Follow DCC pattern from `dcc/config/schemas/error_code_base.json`. | R51 | ✅ | — |
| T1.31 | Pipeline Message Catalog Schema | Create `eks/config/schemas/eks_message_base.json` (message ID format, verbosity levels, categories) and `eks/config/schemas/eks_message_config.json` (milestone, status, progress, warning, error message templates including structural messages). Follow DCC pattern from `dcc/config/schemas/pipeline_message_base.json`. | R51 | ✅ | — |
| T1.32 | Error & Message Manager Modules | Create `eks/engine/core/error_manager.py` (handle_system_error, handle_data_error, fail-fast check, error summary) and `eks/engine/core/message_manager.py` (catalog lookup, template hydration, verbosity control). Create `eks/engine/core/health_scorer.py` (6-dimension scoring: completeness, confidence, structural, source, xref, consistency) and `eks/engine/core/structure_detector.py` (PDF structural element detection). Add `document_elements` table to `registry.py`. Follow DCC pattern from `dcc/workflow/core_engine/errors/error_manager.py`. | R51 | ✅ | — |
| T1.41 | Fix error/message schemas 3-layer pattern | Create `eks_error_setup_schema.json` and `eks_message_setup_schema.json` (allOf + $ref to base). Clean config files (remove $schema/$id/title/description/version). Update `schema_loader.py` with error/message validation methods. Resolve I014. | R51 | ✅ | 2026-06-22 |
| T1.68 | Wire ErrorManager/MessageManager into pipeline orchestrator | Call `ErrorManager.handle_system_error()` and `ErrorManager.handle_data_error()` at runtime in `pipeline_orchestrator.py`: emit D4/D5 error codes on phase failures and per-file parse failures; call `MessageManager.format()` for D6 milestone messages at phase start/complete. Resolves AGENTS.md §6.9 violation. | R51 | ✅ Done | T1.70, T1.72 |
| T1.69 | Add run_id correlation ID to EKSLogger and _LogCapture | Add `run_id: Optional[str]` param to `EKSLogger.__init__`; prepend `[run_id]` to all log entries. In `phase1_server.py` `_handle_pipeline_start()`, pass `job_id` as `run_id` to `_LogCapture` and `PipelineOrchestrator` logger so all log entries for a job share a traceable ID (universal §4.12 Structured Logging & Correlation IDs). Persist per-run log to `eks/output/debug_log.json` (T1.76). | R33, R51 | ✅ | T1.76 |
| T1.71 | Replace raw duckdb.connect in _update_doc_status | Replace `__import__('duckdb').connect(str(self.registry.db_path))` in `pipeline_orchestrator.py` `_update_doc_status()` with a call to a new `registry.update_document_status(doc_id, status, confidence, notes)` method that uses the existing `_with_retry()` wrapper and the registry singleton connection. | R02 | ✅ Done | T1.68 |
| T1.75 | Activate ErrorManager/MessageManager in phase1_server | **Closes silent T1.68 gap**: `phase1_server.py` constructs `PipelineOrchestrator` WITHOUT passing `error_manager`/`message_manager`, so the T1.68 wiring is dead code in production. Construct `ErrorManager(registry.logger)` and `MessageManager(...)` loading `eks_error_config.json`/`eks_message_config.json`, and pass them to `PipelineOrchestrator(...)`. Verify D5/S-PIP error codes and D6 status messages appear in `GET /api/v1/pipeline/logs/{job_id}`. | R51, R99 | ✅ | T1.68, T1.76 |
| T1.76 | Persist debug/message/status JSON to eks/output | Per AGENTS.md §7/§19, generate machine-parseable run artifacts in `eks/output/`: (1) `debug_log.json` — pass `debug_file=eks/output/debug_log.json` to `EKSLogger("Phase1Server")` and call `save_debug_log()` at end of `_run()`; (2) `pipeline_status_{job_id}.json` — write final `_job_state[job_id]` summary; (3) `pipeline_messages_{job_id}.json` — write MessageManager/ErrorManager catalog output for the run. Mirrors DCC `dcc/output/` artifact convention. | R51, R99 | ✅ | T1.69, T1.75 |

## 24. Initiation Integrity, Hardening & Harmonization (T1.77–T1.89)

Phase 1 foundation is extended by two follow-on initiation work batches that close DCC-alignment gaps and universalize project-setup validation. Detailed test evidence lives in the consolidated foundation report (§24/§25) and in `../archive/phase_1_t179_t183_report.md` (RP-EKS-P1-T179-001, archived) for T1.79–T1.83.

### 24. Initiation Integrity (T1.77–T1.78)1
- **T1.77**: `ProjectSetupValidator.validate_all()` + `get_readiness_status()` wired into `phase1_server._run()` fail-fast gate; `--debug`/`--level` CLI flags with effective-level logic; `data_dir` existence + `recursive` bool validated before concurrency guard. 8 validator unit tests + 3 server integration tests. 202/202 pass.
- **T1.78**: Remediation of DCC gaps — `eks.yml`→`eks/eks.yml` path fix, input-file readability (G2), dependency probe + output-path validation (G3/G4), `--skip-readiness` override (G5), error code constants (G7); fixed pre-existing `_LogCapture.level` bug. 207/207 pass.

### 24. Initiation Schema-Driven Hardening (T1.79–T1.83)2
| Task | I-Ref | Description | Status |
| :--- | :---- | :---------- | :----: |
| T1.79 | I079 | Wire `P1-SETUP-*` error codes into `validate_all()` results; raise readiness failure via `ErrorManager.handle_system_error("P1-SETUP-READINESS")` | ✅ |
| T1.80 | I080 | Derive output/eks.yml paths from `global_paths` + schema config | ✅ |
| T1.81 | I081 | Remove hardcoded fallback lists duplicating `eks_config.json` (SSOT) | ✅ |
| T1.82 | I082/I083 | Honor `validation_options.auto_create_folders` + schema-driven input defaults | ✅ |
| T1.83 | I084 | Make `eks` package root schema-driven via `global_paths.eks_root` (10× `PRJ_DIR/"eks"` literals replaced) | ✅ |

Full test-case detail (T1.79-a … T1.83-c) is integrated into the foundation report §24.3 and the archived `../archive/phase_1_t179_t183_report.md`.

### 24. Initiation Harmonization (T1.84–T1.89) — see §113
Universal `ValidationManager` + EKS `project_setup` reshape to the DCC object model. Full scope, task breakdown, files, and success criteria are consolidated in §25 below (sourced from WP-EKS-P1.3-001).

## 25. Phase 1.3 — Initiation Schema & Validation Harmonization (T1.84–T1.89)

**Source workplan (archived)**: [phase_1.3_initiation_harmonization_workplan.md](../archive/phase_1.3_initiation_harmonization_workplan.md) — WP-EKS-P1.3-001
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE — T1.84–T1.89 all implemented. Universal `ValidationManager` in `common/library/utility/validation/`. EKS `project_setup` schema reshaped to DCC-aligned object model. DCC itself NOT modified (deferred follow-up).

### 25. Objective1
Achieve **schema-design consistency** and **code-module universality** for project-setup validation, so that EKS and (later) DCC validate project structure through one shared, well-tested module and through schemas that follow the same shape. EKS's AGENTS.md §7-mandated folder names are preserved — only the *schema shape* (not the folder names) aligns with DCC.

### 25. Task Breakdown3
- **T1.84** — Create universal `ValidationManager` in `common/library/utility/validation/manager.py` (path-agnostic, takes `base_path`), modeled on DCC's mature `validation_manager.py` + `initiation_engine/validators/items.py`. Methods: `validate_folders` (with `auto_created`), `validate_named_files` (generic for `root_files`/`schema_files`), `validate_environment` (location-aware), `validate_dependencies` (required/optional/engines probe), `validate_discovery_rules`, `validate_project_setup`. Structured result `{readiness, folders, files, environment, dependencies, error_codes[]}`; emits codes via `common/library/core/errors/error_manager.py`. Exported from `__init__.py`.
- **T1.85** — Reshape EKS base/setup schema defs to DCC-aligned object model. In `eks_base_schema.json`, replace flat-array defs (`required_folder_setup_def`, `required_engine_subfolder_setup_def`, `required_file_setup_def`, `environment_setup_def`, `validation_options_def`) with 8 object defs: `folder_entry_def`, `root_file_entry_def`, `schema_file_entry_def`, `discovery_rule_def`, `environment_entry_def`, `dependency_config_def`, `validation_rule_def`, `project_metadata_def`. In `eks_setup_schema.json`, reshape `project_setup` to `folders` / `root_files` / `schema_files` / `discovery_rules` / `environment` / `dependencies` / `validation_rules` / `project_metadata`; keep `additionalProperties: false`. `global_paths_def` untouched.
- **T1.86** — Extract `project_setup` instance data to `eks_project_setup_config.json` v1.0.0 (20 folders, root files, schema files, environment, dependencies, project metadata); remove inline `project_setup` from `eks_config.json` v1.5.0, wire via the `$ref`/`ConfigRegistry` mechanism used by `eks_project_rules_config.json` (T1.67). `global_paths` stays in `eks_config.json`.
- **T1.87** — Refactor `setup_validator.py` v0.7 to a thin adapter delegating to `common.library.validation.ValidationManager`. Preserve public `validate_all()` / `get_missing_items()` signatures, `P1-SETUP-*` error codes (universal generic codes mapped to `P1-SETUP-*`), and `ErrorManager.handle_system_error("P1-SETUP-READINESS")` readiness gate. Add `_convert_flat_to_object()` for backward compat.
- **T1.88** — Migrate `test_setup_validator.py` (19 tests) to object-array config; create `test_validation_manager.py` (20 tests) for the universal module. Full EKS suite 235/235 green.
- **T1.89** — Update workplan, `knowledge.json` v2.3.0, `update_log` (U130), `issue_log` (I085 resolved), `common/universal_pipeline_architecture_design.md`, and the foundation report. Generate `phase_1_t179_t183_report.md` (now archived in `eks/archive/`) and this §25 integration.

### 25. Files and Modules (T1.84–T1.89)4
| File/Folder | Action | Purpose |
| :---------- | :----- | :------ |
| `common/library/utility/validation/manager.py` | Create | Universal, path-agnostic `ValidationManager` |
| `common/library/utility/validation/__init__.py` | Update | Export `ValidationManager` |
| `eks/config/schemas/eks_project_setup_config.json` | Create | Instance data for `project_setup` (object model) |
| `eks/config/schemas/eks_base_schema.json` | Update | Replace flat-array defs with 8 DCC-aligned object defs (v1.7.0) |
| `eks/config/schemas/eks_setup_schema.json` | Update | Reshape `project_setup` property (v1.4.0) |
| `eks/config/schemas/eks_config.json` | Update | Remove inline `project_setup`; keep `global_paths` + `$ref` (v1.5.0) |
| `eks/engine/core/setup_validator.py` | Update | Thin adapter delegating to universal `ValidationManager` (v0.7) |

| `eks/test/test_validation_manager.py` | Create | Unit tests for universal module (20) |

### 25. Success Criteria5
- [x] EKS `project_setup` schema shape matches DCC's (object arrays with metadata; per-folder `auto_created`).
- [x] Reusable `ValidationManager` exists in `common/library/utility/validation/` and is path-agnostic (usable by EKS and later DCC).
- [x] EKS validation runs through the universal module; `phase1_server.py` readiness gate, `P1-SETUP-*` codes, and `ErrorManager` wiring behaviorally unchanged.
- [x] Full EKS test suite green (235/235); universal module has its own tests (20).
- [x] DCC left untouched (deferred follow-up).
- [x] Workplan, `knowledge.json`, `update_log`, `issue_log`, and universal architecture doc updated.

## 26. Initiation Config Flattening — DCC project_config Pattern (T1.90–T1.95)

**Objective**: Align EKS `eks_config.json` with DCC `project_config.json` — store the actual setup values (`folders` / `root_files` / `schema_files` / `environment` / `dependencies` / `project_metadata` / `discovery_rules`) at the **top level** instead of nested under a `project_setup` wrapper. This makes the universal `ValidationManager` (and a future universal schema loader) work for both projects with **zero per-project branching**, completing the Phase 1.3 universality goal, and removes the orphaned `eks_project_setup_config.json` (T1.86 artifact).

## 27. Schema Discovery & Registration — Discovery-Driven Loading (T1.96)

**Objective**: Add discovery-driven schema registration to EKS by (a) extracting the shared `discover_schema_files()` function from DCC `ref_resolver.py:164-230` into the `common/` library, (b) adding `discovery_rules` data to `eks_config.json`, (c) refactoring `schema_loader.py` to use config-driven loading (explicit `schema_files` + `discovery_rules` glob), and (d) wiring `ValidationManager.validate_discovery_rules()` into `setup_validator.py`. Closes I087.

**Rationale**: Currently `schema_loader.py` hardcodes 22 filenames — adding a new schema set requires source code changes. DCC's `_extract_registered_schemas()` implements a reusable pattern: explicit `schema_files` merge with glob-based `discovery_rules`. Extracting this to `common/` makes it available to both projects and future phases.

## 28. System Parameters — SSOT Centralization (T1.97)

**Objective**: Centralize all runtime behavior knobs (`fail_fast`, `log_level`, `debug_mode`, `skip_readiness`, `retry_count`, `retry_delay`, `api_timeout`, `ollama_timeout`, `db_timeout`) into a schema-defined `system_parameters` block in `eks_config.json`. Create a universal `get_system_param()` function in `common/library/config/` that handles both EKS flat-object and DCC array-of-entries shapes. Remove hardcoded equivalents from `phase1_server.py`, `error_manager.py`, `registry.py`, `server.py`. Closes I088.

**Rationale**: Currently these values are scattered across global variables (`phase1_server.py:103-105`), constructor defaults (`error_manager.py:21`), function defaults (`registry.py:326`), and literal constants (`server.py:359,429`). I088 documents this as a SSOT violation versus DCC's `project_config.json → system_parameters` pattern. A universal `get_system_param()` in `common/` makes the fix reusable for DCC and future phases.

### 28. Universal Architecture Elevation (I091)3

**Objective**: Elevate `system_parameters` from a project-specific implementation to a formally defined universal pipeline feature (L15) in `common/universal_pipeline_architecture_design.md`. Register `config` as an architecture-aligned sub-package in `common/library/__init__.py`.

**Rationale**: I091 documents that `common/library/config/__init__.py` exists with `normalize_system_parameters()` and `get_system_param()` but `config` is not listed as an architecture-aligned sub-package in `common/library/__init__.py`, not imported, and not documented in `common/universal_pipeline_architecture_design.md`. Both DCC and EKS implement `system_parameters` independently; the universal architecture must formalize it as L15.

## 29. Universal Path Resolution & Schema-Driven Initialization (I089 + I090)

**Objective**: (1) Adopt EKS's `global_paths` as the universal canonical schema-driven path pattern and provide a shared `PathResolver` in `common/library/paths/` that normalizes both EKS and DCC path shapes — closes **I089**. (2) Bring EKS to DCC parity for `workflow_files`/`tool_files`/`folder_creation` (schema-driven initialization) — closes **I090**.

**Rationale**: A re-audit of DCC's actual code (I089 re-evaluation) found its path model is weaker than EKS's:
- `base_path` is derived by **script-location traversal** (`default_base_path()` walks `Path(__file__).parents` to find `"workflow"`), not from config.
- `data`/`output` dirs are **hardcoded literals** (`base_path / "data"`, `base_path / "output"`).
- `discovery_rules[].directory` are used **only for schema discovery**, not working dirs.
- `folder_creation.required_directories[].name` is used only for auto-create checks.

By contrast, EKS's `global_paths` (hardened by T1.80/T1.82/T1.83 — no hardcoded fallbacks) is **genuinely schema-driven SSOT**. Therefore the universal pattern adopts EKS `global_paths` as canonical, with a bidirectional `PathResolver` normalizing DCC's shape into it. For I090, EKS gains `workflow_files`/`tool_files` blocks (currently absent), while `folder_creation` is satisfied by the resolver deriving the create-list from the canonical `global_paths` — EKS deliberately does **not** add a separate DCC-style `folder_creation` block (documented design decision).

### 29. Scope Summary1

| ID | Category | Title | Details | Status | Related |
| :-- | :------- | :---- | :------ | :----: | :------ |

Decision: folder creation driven by canonical `global_paths` (resolver derives create-list) — no separate DCC-style `folder_creation` block. | ✅ COMPLETE | I090 |
| T1.98g | Code | EKS loader/initializer for `workflow_files`/`tool_files` | Add logic to `setup_validator.py`/`config_registry.py` to register the file manifest and auto-create declared dirs from `global_paths` via resolver (mirrors DCC consumption). | ✅ COMPLETE | I090, T1.98a |
| T1.98h | Testing | Tests + suite green | Add `eks/test/test_path_resolver.py` (EKS + DCC shape normalization) and `workflow_files`/`tool_files` schema tests; full EKS suite 243/243 green. Close I089, I090. | ✅ COMPLETE | I089, I090 |

### 29. Canonical `global_paths` Shape (adopted as universal)2

```json
"global_paths": {
  "data_dir": "data", "output_dir": "output", "archive_dir": "archive",
  "config_dir": "config", "log_dir": "log", "eks_root": "eks"
}
```

DCC's `discovery_rules` + `folder_creation` + native `base_path/"data"` defaults are **normalized into this shape** by the resolver (e.g. `schema_dir` ← first schema-config `discovery_rules` directory; `data_dir` ← `folder_creation` entry named `data` or native default).

## 30. Pipeline Entry-Point & Per-Phase Sub-Pipeline Convergence (I092 / R60)

**Objective**: Resolve I092 by converging EKS pipeline entry points on a shared `run_pipeline(context)` funnel (mirroring DCC's CLI + UI + web → one `run_engine_pipeline(context)`) and satisfying R60 / AGENTS.md §18.13 — every phase (1–5) runs as an independent sub-pipeline with its own `phase{N}_server.py` backend. Phase 1 already has `phase1_server.py`; it needs the convergence cleanup. Phases 2–5 need the full backend + runner.

### 30. Success Criteria2

- [x] Shared `run_pipeline(context)` helper exists and is called by Phase 1 CLI + `phase1_server`.
- [x] EKS CLI (`eks-pipeline`) runs the full pipeline end-to-end.
- [x] `phase1_server._run` calls `run_full_pipeline()` (no inline A→C); 409 + `resolve_paths()` preserved.
- [x] `engine_endpoints.py` removed; `eks/serve.py` present (§18.12).
- [x] `ConfigRegistry` SSOT passed at entry.
- [ ] Phases 2–5 each have a standalone `phase{N}_server.py` + `run_phase{N}_pipeline(context)`; `serve.py` proxies `/api/v{N}/*`.

## 31. Risks and Mitigation

| Risk                                         | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation                                                         |
| :------------------------------------------- | :--------: | :----: | :----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| DB schema changes cascade to downstream code | Medium     | High   | Schema-driven design isolates DB structure from processing logic   |
| PDF/DOCX parsing quality varies by doc type  | High       | Medium | Abstract parser interface allows per-format tuning; log errors     |
| DWG/DGN parsing requires CAD libraries       | High       | Low    | Deferred to Phase 3; stub plug-in interface stubbed in this phase  |
| Schema design diverges from dcc pattern      | Low        | Medium | Explicitly use dcc/config/schemas as template reference            |
| Metadata extraction accuracy is low          | Medium     | Medium | Implement Manual Verification workflow in Phase 5                  |

---

## 32. Potential Future Issues

- CAD format parsing (DWG/DGN) may require specialized third-party libraries or commercial services
- Large document volumes may require async/batch ingestion pipelines
- Document registry may need sharding or partitioning for very large corpora
- Manual verification queue may become a bottleneck if not optimized
