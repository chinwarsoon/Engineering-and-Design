## 1. Test Objective and Scope

**Objective:** Complete all Phase 1 deliverables for BLV-001 — error code catalog corrections for `Submission_Closed` vs `Resubmission_Plan_Date` logic.

**Scope (revised v1.3.0):**
- Error code `L3-L-V-0302` rename and message update across all catalog files
- Error code `L3-L-V-0307` missing catalog entry addition
- `row_validator.py` docstring updates
- `dcc_register_config.json` description update
- Calculation fix **excluded** — merged into Phase 5 (BLV-005) which rewrites the same function

**Out of scope:**
- `apply_resubmission_plan_date` code changes (Phase 5)
- Any pipeline execution or data validation testing (Phase 5 dependency)

## 2. Execution Summary

| Item | Result |
|------|--------|
| Milestones completed | 5 / 5 |
| Files modified | 5 |
| Files created | 0 |
| Errors encountered | 1 (zh.json encoding — resolved by reading exact content first) |
| Regressions introduced | None |
| Calculation logic changed | None (Phase 1 is catalog-only) |

---

## 3. Methodology and Tools

- Direct file inspection via `fsRead` to confirm exact content before replacement
- `fsReplace` for targeted in-place updates
- `executeBash` powershell `Select-String` for post-update verification of all 5 files
- Cross-referenced `row_validator.py` code to confirm `is_latest_mask` logic already correct — no code change required

## 4. Milestone Results

| Milestone | Deliverable | Status |

| M1.2 | Update `en.json` — L3-L-V-0302 message, L3-L-V-0307 entry | ✅ DONE |
| M1.3 | Update `zh.json` — L3-L-V-0302 message, L3-L-V-0307 entry | ✅ DONE |
| M1.4 | Update `row_validator.py` docstrings | ✅ DONE |
| M1.5 | Update `dcc_register_config.json` description | ✅ DONE |

## 7. Pre-Implementation Review Findings

Three issues were identified during pre-implementation review and resolved before proceeding:

| Finding | Resolution |
|---------|------------|
| §5.1.2 A referenced non-existent file `conditional_date.py` | Removed from Phase 1; correct file is `date.py`, fix merged into Phase 5 |
| Calculation fix conflicts with Phase 5 full rewrite of same function | Calculation change removed from Phase 1 scope entirely |
| `L3-L-V-0307` declared in `row_validator.py` but missing from error catalog | Added to Phase 1 deliverables; entry created in `data_error_config.json`, `en.json`, `zh.json` |

---

## 8. Recommendations for Future Actions

- **Phase 5 (BLV-005):** Implement `apply_resubmission_plan_date` full rewrite with row-position-separated logic — this is the actual calculation fix that resolves the 713 BLV-001 rows
- **Regression check after Phase 5:** Verify `L3-L-V-0302` (`LATEST_CLOSED_WITH_PLAN_DATE`) error count drops to 0 in pipeline output
- **Search codebase:** Run a full search for string `CLOSED_WITH_PLAN_DATE` (old name) in any UI, dashboard, or reporting code that may reference it by name

---

## 9. Lessons Learned

- Always read exact file content before replacement when files contain Unicode/CJK characters — powershell `Select-String` may not render encoding correctly but `fsRead` returns accurate content
- Pre-implementation review caught 3 issues before any code was written — workplan review step is essential
- Calculation fixes and error code catalog updates should be tracked as separate deliverables to avoid scope creep between phases
